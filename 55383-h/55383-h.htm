<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. CAROLINE H. BUTLER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There was once in the city of Philadelphia a poor
author whom chilling disappointments and the biting
stings of adversity had brought nigh the grave—whose
high hopes, ardent ambition, and glowing aspirations
for fame, were all quenched and broken beneath the
pressure of penury and wo. The wife, too, of his
bosom had passed on to the shadowy land before him,
and now beckoned him to that blissful home beyond
the grave where sorrow and trouble are unknown.
One fond tie still bound him to life. He was a father.
No other guide—no other friend had that fair young
girl, over whose innocent head scarce sixteen summers
had flown, and for her sake he still clung to a
world whose charms else had long ceased to attract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was an old man whom the world called
unfeeling and miserly, who day by day passed by the
humble home of the author. And day by day as he
passed along, saw at the window a pale young face
bent over the endless seam, and a small white hand
never tiring busily plying the needle. Or sometimes
marked the child’s own feeble strength tasked to support
the tottering steps of suffering manhood to the
open window, that the air of heaven might revive that
languid frame, while the hollow, racking cough, and
the fever spot on the cheek, like a rose rooted in the
grave and blossoming in beauty above, told too plainly
consumption had made its victim sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then one day when the window was darkened,
and he missed the pale young face, the heart of the
old man smote him as he passed along, and turning he
gently sought admittance, and from that time over the
bed of the sufferer the thin, white locks of the old man
mingled with the golden ringlets of Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heaven surely had first softened his heart, and then
guided his footsteps thither, for, like a ministering
angel he came to the house of sorrow to soothe the
last moments of the dying man, and protect the fatherless
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cheered once more by the voice of kindness—his
feeble frame invigorated by healthful nourishment—surrounded
by comforts long unknown, or remembered
but as a dream in the dark night of poverty he had
passed through—what wonder the sick man rallied,
and for a time gave way to the flattering hope that he
might yet leave a bright legacy to his child—a name
crowned with imperishable fame. His mind, long
shattered by sickness, caught back something of the
fire of youth, and once more his trembling hand seized
the pen as the powerful instrument through which
riches and honor were to flow in upon him. But, as
the meteor which for an instant shoots over the wave
in sparkling beauty, and then sinks in the darkness of
the fathomless gulf below, was the momentary out-flashing
of that once brilliant mind, ere the darkness of
the grave encompassed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he felt the power of death too surely pressing
upon him, he took the hand of the old man and placed
it on the head of his kneeling child with a look pleading
for kindness and protection. The heart of old
<a id='abel1'></a>Abel May answered to this silent appeal, and stooping
down he imprinted a kiss upon the brow of Florence,
solemnly promising never to forsake her. The dying
man raised his eyes in gratitude to heaven, and with a last
effort clasping his beloved child to his breast, expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sad duties left for the living to perform over the
venerated dust of those we have loved, were ended
with tears and lamentation—and now in the wide
world had Florence no friend but old Abel May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Florence,” said the old man, “I have long since
buried the ties of kindred—they could not survive ingratitude
and distrust. I had but one left to love—but
one whom selfishness and sordid expectations did not
bind to me—and now he too has gone. I am now as
much alone, my child, as you—I in the winter of age,
you in spring’s freshest bloom. You shall be to me
as the dearest of daughters, as pure and precious in
my eyes as God’s sacred word—although as my wife
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
the world only must know you. Then, Florence, will
you give yourself to me; will you look upon me in the
light of that beloved parent whose loss you now deplore—will
you confide yourself to me in your loneliness
and helplessness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the innocent girl, lifting her meek blue eyes to
the furrowed countenance of the old man, threw herself
confidingly upon his bosom, and wept her thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were married; and then, as some priceless
jewel committed to his charge, which to guard and
cherish was henceforth to be his pride and happiness
did Abel May bear home the young orphan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years he had occupied a large mansion
near the outskirts of the city, whose dark granite front
and heavy wooden shutters kept constantly closed,
imparted an air of chilliness and gloom to the neighborhood
of flashy brick houses and light airy cottages by
which it was environed. Abel May lived alone, keeping
no domestics, and either preparing his own meals,
or partaking of them at a restaurateur’s. Occasionally
the woman whom he employed to do his washing was
admitted to sweep and arrange his sleeping room and
the little parlor adjoining. The other apartments were
always locked, baffling all the curiosity of which no
doubt the good woman partook with others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Various opinions and rumors were afloat concerning
him in the neighborhood, through which however the
old man steered steadily and regardlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not greater was the surprise of the captive princess
in the fairy tale on awakening one morning and finding
before her window a sumptuous palace rearing high
its golden columns, where alone frowning rocks and
dark, turbid waters had before stood, than was the
amazement which pervaded the neighborhood, when
early one morning they were aroused from slumber by
the <span class='it'>clink—clink—clink</span> of the busy hammer, the
crashing of tiles, and sonorous fall of boards upon the
pavements. And behold, every window of that gloomy
house was thrown wide to the glare of day—workmen
were on the roof—workmen were scaling ladders—workmen
were tearing off those clumsy shutters, while
within, workmen in paper caps and white aprons
were busily wielding the several instruments of
their handicraft. Day after day their labors went
on, and day after day added to the astonishment of the
neighbors. Plate-glass and light Venetian blinds soon
supplanted the small window panes and wooden shutters—a
tasteful portico and marble slabs supplied the
place of the clumsy iron railing and high stone steps
so jagged and worn. Carpenters, masons, and painters
speedily completed the interior renovation, and then
followed heavily laden drays bearing rich furniture—and
upholsterers flew from room to room giving the
last graceful touch of taste and fashion to the arrangement
of the various articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next came the overwhelming announcement that
old Abel May was married, and that the sylph-like,
graceful form, and sunny ringlets of the fair young
girl sometimes seen bending from the window, or
leaning on the arm of the old man, like a lily grafted
on some withered branch, belonged to no other than
the bride—and wonder ceased not, but rather grew
with the “food it fed on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not much less was the surprise of Florence at finding
herself suddenly the mistress of a home so charming.
She had never connected the idea of wealth with the
plainly dressed humble old man who had so benevolently
administered to the comforts of her dying parent,
and cheerfully did she prepare to follow him to a home,
no matter how lowly, so that love and kindness were
to be found there. When, then, old Abel May, lifting
her tenderly from the carriage which bore them from
the church wherein the solemn rite making them man
and wife had just been pronounced, and led her into
apartments so splendid, with all that a refined taste
might approve, or a fastidious eye applaud, was it
strange that for a moment the young orphan doubted
whether all was not, indeed, a dream or a fairy creation,
such as the pen of her father had often sketched
for her amusement—for never did her waking eyes or
her sober senses dwell on aught so rich and beautiful.
Yet neither the elegance by which she was surrounded,
nor the charms which novelty lent to her new existence,
could for a long time withdraw her mind from
dwelling on the irreparable loss she had sustained.
Happily, youth is not prone to despondency; hope in
the bright future buoys them exultingly over the
billows of disappointment which engulf so many
sorrow-stricken hearts, and therefore as time wore on
it made the old man’s soul rejoice to see smiles chasing
away the tears from the countenance of this dear
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The education of Florence had been conducted solely
under the careful tuition of her father, and her active
mind, regulated and nourished by judicious application.
In the French and German languages she was a correct
scholar, and had attained some little proficiency
in drawing; yet of music or other elegant acquirements
she knew nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hard are the lessons of adversity; and that his
humble means precluded his bestowing on his child
those accomplishments for which nature had so eminently
qualified her, was often a source of deep regret
to her fond parent; but now, under the fostering care
of the old man, how splendidly did her talents develop
themselves. Music and painting opened for her a
new world of enjoyment, and no expense did her kind
protector withhold to gratify to the fullest extent her
eager desire for improvement. He engaged the most
eminent masters to attend upon her, nor did the proficiency
of the pupil shame their skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very limited was the society which Abel May admitted
within his walls, and those only such as he
considered worthy of his friendship and confidence.
This gave no disquiet to Florence; indeed, company
rather pained than pleased her. Her most delightful
hours were those in which she could add to the happiness
of the old man, by the exercise of those agreeable
sources of entertainment owing their origin to
him, or when with pencil or book, alone in the beautiful
little apartment which the same kind hand had
fitted up expressly for her use, the moments flew unheeding
in the all absorbing interest they inspired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally, at the Opera or Theatres, old Abel
May appeared with his beautiful young wife; or perhaps,
in the delightful coolness of a summer’s morning,
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
ere yet the noisy din of the city pervaded the air, or
the dust of its countless thoroughfares swept over the
dewy freshness of night, they sauntered through the
silent streets or shady avenues of Washington Square.
But more frequently still within the sacred precincts
of Laurel Hill were they seen to wander. In one of
its most retired spots, where a cluster of drooping
willows brushed the dew-drops from the tall, rank
grass, and the murmur of the wave below came up
sadly yet sweetly upon the ear, a plain monumental
stone was planted. “My Father Sleeps,” was the
only sign it bore; and to this consecrated spot did
their steps most often turn, for well did one fond heart
know <span class='it'>who</span> slept so peaceful there, and over this hallowed
grave the fair form of Florence bent in filial
devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherever she appeared the admiration she attracted
was universal; and if some were prone to pity her lot,
as being bound by such indissoluble ties to old Abel
May, they were quite at fault by her bright, sunny
countenance which certainly bore no traces of hidden
sorrows for their sympathies to probe. This might
have flattered the pride of the old man while it aroused
his fears. His own life he knew, in the common
course of nature, could not be prolonged many years,
and then what was to become of that young girl thus
thrown a second time upon the world, so beautiful and
so unprotected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was but one person whom he ever mentioned
in terms of affection to Florence, and this was his
nephew, and the only son of a favorite brother, long
since dead, who bore his name, and whom he had
destined for his heir. But for many years young Abel
May had not been heard from, and his friends had
finally given up all expectations of ever seeing him
again. It was said that being repeatedly reproached
by envious relatives on account of the interest his rich
uncle manifested for him, calling him a poor gentleman—a
hanger-on—only waiting to step into dead
men’s shoes, with remarks of the like nature, originating
in low, vulgar minds, and that being a lad of
high spirit, he became disgusted and angered, and
vowing he would either make his own fortune or never
return, young May suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length age and infirmities pressed more and more
sorely upon the good old man. Soon he could no
longer leave the house or even his chamber—and then
it was he felt how rich a treasure he possessed in
Florence. With how much tenderness and love did
she watch over him, patiently enduring with all the
querulousness and complainings of an old age racked
with torturing pains; never weary, neither by day nor
by night, ever devising, ever executing some plan
which might soothe his troubles either of body or
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man died, leaving his fortune to Florence,
upon one condition—the strangest, surely, that ever
guided the pen of a dying man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never was so singular a will written—never was
any thing more absurd! And for more than a month,
which is certainly a long time for any wonder to stand
its ground against the constant pressure of newer
marvels, for more than a month after the coffin and the
tomb had alike received their due, the city rang with
the whimsicality of the last will and testament of old
<a id='abel2'></a>Abel May, who by this said will had compelled his
young, blooming widow either to marry within a
year of his demise, or otherwise forfeit to relatives innumerable
that fine fortune which, with this proviso,
he had bequeathed to her alone. The motives which
actuated him were doubtless intended as a kindness to
the young girl whom his death would leave unprotected.
He overlooked the dangers to which he thus
exposed her from the crafty wiles of the spendthrift
and fortune-hunter, or he trusted, perhaps, that her innocence
and loveliness might shield her against their
artifices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From marble-columned squares and by-lanes—from
suburban cottages and distant villages, disappointed
relatives came flocking in like a flight of hungry crows,
one and all croaking forth the will a forgery; or that
their beloved relative, for whom weepers a yard long
streamed in the wind, and black veils fluttered hopefully,
through weakness of body and consequent imbecility
of mind, had been influenced by an artful young
wife to draw up the unrighteous instrument to which
his signature was attached. A likely story, truly, that
passing by uncles and nephews, aunts and nieces, to
say nothing of innumerable cousins of the first and
third degree, he should have thrown his whole fortune
into the hands of a young girl, one, too, whom
they all were convinced he had married only that she
might nurse his old body when gout or rheumatism
should rack his bones, but that he also should have
added to this unheard of folly his commands for her to
marry, and by that means allow his hard-earned riches
to pass into the hands of nobody knows who—any
beggar she might choose to call up from squalid rags
to fine linen and <a id='broad'></a>broadcloth, why that passed all
bounds of belief. There had been intrigue and treachery
somewhere; poor old Abel! it brought tears
into their affectionate eyes even to think of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, unfortunately alike to their jealous affection
and hopeful schemes, the lawyers possessed a quietus
in a certain document drawn up and attested by competent
witnesses, which ran thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereas jealous and evil-minded persons may
seem inclined to dispute my last will and testament, I
hereby declare in the presence of —— and of ——,
that, as my dear wife, Florence, has been to me the
kindest and most tender of wives, denying herself for
my sake those pleasures and amusements natural to
her youth, and has cheerfully devoted herself to
nursing a poor, feeble old man, I do in token of my
love, approbation, and gratitude, give unto her without
reserve all the property of which I may die possessed,
both personal and real. And furthermore, I do most
earnestly entreat of her to choose some deserving
young man whom she may take as a husband, and
that she may be happy in such choice, and be rewarded
thereby for her goodness to me, I pray God!
And that she may be influenced the more readily
perhaps to comply with this, my last request, I do
hereby declare that unless within one year from my
demise she does make such choice, and marry in accordance,
I do annul and make void my will in her
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
favor, my fortune in such case to be disposed of as
stipulated in my will and testament.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when the smiling lawyers holding such a
damper over the high hopes of the solemn conclave of
mourners, made known to them the existence of this
last document, uncles and aunts bounced out of the
house like roasted chestnuts seething and smoking with
the fire of anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so the young nephews and the gallant cousins.
Down they went on their knees before the young
widow, swearing she was divine—an angel—a goddess—and
right glad were they that the sensible old gentleman
had given her his fortune, for she deserved it,
in faith she did—and they hoped she would marry immediately;
heavens! any body might be proud to receive
her hand—what was the paltry gold in comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And each one of the seven secretly resolved to woo
and win her, and—<span class='it'>the fortune to boot</span>! But Florence
only cast down her eyes and wept unfeigned sorrow
for the loss of a kind old man—her husband and
benefactor.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Florence May was, indeed, a bewitching little widow—only
eighteen, and with nearly half a million of
dollars in her rosy little palm. The evening star bursting
through a cloud was not more bright than were her
eyes twinkling through the veil of sable crape, or
if perchance some saucy zephyr brushed aside the
envious <span class='it'>weed</span>, what charming flowers were thereby
disclosed—what tempting roses and lilies, and sweet,
blue violets, all bathed in the golden sunshine of her
glittering tresses. Ah, yes—and then the golden sunshine
of those glittering guineas—truly was she not a
most adorable widow!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And never was a poor little widow so tormented
with lovers since the world began. <span class='it'>Dingle, dingle,
dingle</span>, quoth the door-bell incessantly; <span class='it'>tap, tap, tap</span>,
urged the maid at the entrance of her private sitting-room,
until the poor child wearied of shaking her little
head, and uttering a “No!” to their various demands
for admittance. With cards, and tender <span class='it'>billet-doux</span>,
her tables were overburthened, while pluming themselves
upon their relationship, the seven cousins and
nephews intruded without ceremony into her presence,
eyeing each other with jealous defiance, and snarling
and snapping like a parcel of angry lap-dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do bite my thumb, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir—but I
bite my thumb, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighborhood were kept alive with surmises as
to who would win the rich heiress, daily expecting to
see a gay wedding party issuing forth, in contrast to
the gloomy funereal spectacle so lately before them.
Yet weeks and months rolled on uneventful. What
could it mean? Was the widow crazy or bewitched?
How could she remain so unconcerned when her fortune
was at stake! Day after day was poverty stealthily
drawing nearer, in as much as she still neglected to
fulfill the terms on which her fortune rested, and yet
she moved about as careless and indifferent as though
the comforts and elegancies which surrounded her
were unconditionally hers—what a strange creature
she must be!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thus reasoned the “lookers on in Venice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months of widowhood were passed. Florence
was still unmarried; and once more the relatives took
heart against despair, and golden visions mingled in
their day-dreams. Her obstinacy was to them inexplicable—for
they knew upon the separate assurances
of the several nephews and cousins that she had had
<span class='it'>unexceptionable</span> offers, and if from those choice specimens
of man she could not select a husband, why, of
course, they had reason to hope she never would be
married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the state of affairs, when one day Florence
received the following note, written in an unknown
hand, accompanied with a bouquet of beautiful flowers:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Madam</span>,—I have seen you, and who that has
once looked upon you but must adore you! I dare not
approach you, nor would I mingle with the throng of
flatterers around you. Enough for me to worship at
a distance, and to guard with my whole soul that
treasure which may never be mine. My life I would
willingly lay at your feet, but there are important
reasons why you should not know me. Of one thing,
madam, rest assured, you have a friend who will
secretly watch over you, and guard you from every
danger.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Upon a mind so artless as that of Florence, this singular
note, which was without signature, produced a very
pleasing influence, and excited a lively interest for the
unknown writer. The idea of possessing such a friend
inspired her with a degree of confidence such as she had
not known since the death of her husband. Nor to that
one note did the unknown limit his attentions—they
were manifested in various ways. Ofttimes in the
sweet language of flowers they were spoken—or to
her little boudoir some rare and exquisite painting
found its way. Books, too, with penciled margins, all
evincing a pure and elegant perception; music, which,
when awakened by her fingers, breathed the very
spirit of melody; and when from the same unknown
hand there came a beautiful cage, whence the tiny
warbler trilled forth in sweetest notes her favorite airs,
Florence was lost in amazement. Who, then, was
this mysterious person who so well understood her
tastes, and who was thus ever studying her happiness?
The note had stated: “There are important reasons
why you should not know me.” And Florence was
possessed of too much delicacy, and had too much respect
for the writer of the note to seek to penetrate
the mystery. Yet by the use which she made of his
gifts, her silent thanks to the donor were expressed,
and insensibly yielding to the delightful associations
they called forth, she felt as if some kind guardian was
ever near shielding her from evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oft amid the rich braids of her hair those fragrant
flowers were intertwined, or rested above a heart not
less pure than themselves. The books acquired a
new interest that other eyes had dwelt also upon their
pages; and never did her fingers so skillfully or so
tenderly touch the keys, as when before her was the
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
music which the unknown had conveyed to her; many
times, too, the soft, sweet tones of a flute were heard
echoing the strain. When first they reached her ear,
Florence hushed her instrument and closed the window;
but at midnight, again and again the same sweet strains
floated around her, and then she felt it could be no
other than the unknown, who, in music’s gentle voice,
addressed her, and this belief added greatly to the
charmed life she was leading, thus mysteriously watched
over and protected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now that chance brought her acquainted with
a person whom we must allow to introduce himself to
the reader by the following letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>From Charles Crayford to his friend, Hastings.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in luck, my dear fellow; give me joy, for
Fortune, blessed goddess, hath at length wafted me to
the favor of wealth and beauty. ’Pon my soul, I know
not which I am the most in love with, the person or
the fortune of the divinity. Her name is May—Florence
May. She is a widow—a young, blooming,
bewitching widow, with half a million at her own
free disposal, and, happily, without a relative in the
world, or jealous guardian to cavil about disparity of
fortune, or pry into secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But how—and when—and where—did you meet
your divinity?’ you ask. Listen, then, and admire my
policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Passing down Chestnut street in a somewhat moralizing
vein—unheeding the light forms and bright eyes
flitting past me, and coining some new device to elude
the importunities of my landlady and tailor, when,
just as I reached the Washington House, the whole
moving multitude came to a sudden halt—the cause of
which I never even thought to ascertain—for “more
attractive metal” at that moment drew my attention.
On the steps of the hotel, my <a id='eye'></a>eye caught the fairest
vision ever mortal beheld. It was that of a young
and beautiful girl, but whether descending from the
house, or newly alighted from Paradise, may I forfeit
her guineas if I can tell. She was accompanied by a
respectable looking middle-aged woman, whom I
judged to be a domestic. I noticed the heavenly eyes
of this beautiful creature were bent with pity upon a
pale, sickly little girl, who was trying to sell a few
bunches of flowers among the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will you buy my flowers?’ said the child to a
fashionably dressed lady—‘Will you buy my flowers—only
a <span class='it'>fip</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Really,’ exclaimed the fine lady, taking no notice
whatever of the gentle voice and beseeching looks of
the little girl—‘these genteel beggars are an insufferable
nuisance!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will you buy my flowers?’ again asked the child
of a pompous old gentleman, who stood pulling and
vaporing before me—‘Buy my flowers, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Out of the way—quick—be off—or I will have
you taken up for a vagrant!’ cried the pompous gentleman,
elevating his gold-headed cane and shaking it
over her head. Hastings, you should have seen the
bright glow of indignation which flushed the cheeks
of my charmer as this rude speech met her ear! My
good genius nudged my elbow, and prompted me to
pity the poor child. ‘Come here, my dear, and I will
buy your flowers,’ I said. The frightened little girl
sprung quickly to my side and looked imploringly up
in my face. ‘And where do you live?’ I continued,
confident that the eyes of the fair one were upon me,
and taking out my tablets, I affected to note down her
answer—then slipping some money into her hand,
(what improvidence you will say,) I added—‘Keep
the flowers, my poor child, perhaps you can sell them
again.’ ’Pon my soul, the look of approbation which
beamed from her eyes, as mine <span class='it'>casually</span> glanced toward
the beautiful unknown, would have melted the
heart of a miser to compassion. The crowd now began
to move. In passing the little flower-girl my
divinity endeavored to slip some money into her hand,
but in the confusion and press of the moment it fell
upon the pavement. I quickly picked it up and gave
it to the child, and—lucky dog—received a bow of
thanks and a sweet smile as my reward. Now mark
the continued favors of the jade Fortune. That very
evening, I don’t know what tempted me to call upon
those prosy, clever people the Livermores, and there
who should I meet but the same bewitching fair one.
Ah, Hastings, ‘there is a divinity that shapes our
ends;’ have I not proved it to you? I saw at once she
recognized me as the hero of the morning’s adventure,
and having then made my appearance in the character
of <span class='it'>excellence</span>, I now topped the same part to perfection.
I found her as far superior in mental as in personal
charms to those around her, and when my hostess
whispered me that she was also the uncontrolled mistress
of a fortune, my heart melted at once—<span class='it'>in the
crucible of Mammon!</span> The next day I took the liberty
to call upon her, and was most graciously received,
and have been a frequent visiter since. You should
hear my conversation, Hastings—you would discredit
the evidence of your senses. I affect morality and
virtue—quote Cowper and Milton, and hint at charities
committed <span class='it'>sub-rosa</span>. Think of becoming the husband
of such a young, pretty dove-eyed creature—ay, and
to husband the money, too, instead of marrying age
and deformity for the sake of the gilding! By the way,
I find my fair one wastes her fortune prodigiously upon
paupers and charitable institutions. I shall look after
this by and by; in the meantime, I am willing she
should consider me a pattern of disinterested goodness.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was no wonder that Florence should have been
deceived by one so artful and designing as Crayford.
Her first introduction to him was calculated to impress
her strongly in his favor—a vantage ground
which he knew well how to maintain. His conversation
so artfully fraught with morality—the correct
and refined taste he manifested for music, for painting,
and all those acquirements which were so delightful
to her—his well argued schemes of philanthropy,
added to an elegant person and insinuating address,
might have deceived one less ingenuous and confiding
than Florence. In him all those delightful influences
with which the unknown had surrounded her seemed
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
concentrated; in fact, as one and the same she began
gradually to blend them in her imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day, therefore, was the dangerous Crayford
admitted to her presence, and each day more
securely planting himself in her favor. In the meantime
the seven nephews and cousins made common
cause, and fought bravely against this new aspirant,
whom they saw plainly was fast bearing off the prize
from them, until alarmed by several very unequivocal
threats from Crayford, they vanished, leaving the field
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But where, all this time, was the friend who had so
ardently pledged himself her protector, surely now
was the time when his voice should not be silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small casket was one day placed in the hands of
Florence, which, on opening, she found to contain a
brooch, representing a stem of the lily of the valley,
emblem of purity and innocence, composed of beautiful
pearls, but around which a small, glittering snake was
entwined. The head of the reptile, its forked tongue
darting fire, was bent over the sweet floweret as if with
its noxious venom it would destroy it forever. The
snake was of emeralds—the eyes and tongue of small
sparkling rubys. On lifting the brooch, a folded paper
dropped from it, on which was traced in the same
well known characters:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware, pure and innocent lily—the charmer is
near, but his breath is poison!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Crayford alone she knew this singular warning
could refer, and it caused her at first both dismay and
sorrow. Could it be, then, that he was a villain!
Could it be that under an exterior so pleasing vice and
deformity could hide itself; no, it was impossible!
Florence had no room in her heart for suspicions so
cruel toward any one. Of friendship abused—of confidence
violated, or of the heart’s warm affection betrayed,
that most bitter lesson of life she had yet to
learn. Ah, happy those, who, on their journey through
life, may never meet with its truths!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And was it not unjust, she argued, to receive implicitly
the words of one unknown to the prejudice of
one whom she did know, and who appeared every
way so estimable. Might she not also attribute to
jealousy this singular interference of one who had
already declared himself to be her lover. The more
she dwelt upon this conclusion, the more reasonable it
appeared; and finally closing the casket, she prepared
to fulfill an engagement with Crayford to visit the
Academy of Fine Arts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the drawing-room she found him already waiting
for her, and apologizing for her delay, they immediately
set forth upon the intended expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had Crayford appeared more brilliant, more
fascinating than this morning; and was it strange that
the warning of the unknown should have passed from
her thoughts as a dream. As they reached the corner
of —— Square, Florence suddenly observed a young
woman, very pale, and meanly attired, who, leaning
against the iron railing, was fixedly gazing upon her
with a look of such utter despair and misery, as excited
at once her pity and curiosity. A miserable
cloak closely enveloped her person, the hood of which
was held tightly around the lower part of her face by
her thin white hand, yet did not conceal the ghastly
pallor of her countenance. Her eyes were uncommonly
large, and of a soft, lustrous black; it even
seemed to Florence they were filled with tears, and
her brow looked as cold and pure as the brow of the
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What beautiful eyes!” said she, in a low voice to
her companion; “pray look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Crayford sought the wretched object Florence
pointed out, he started as though an adder had stung
him, and would have hurried on, but the girl, with an
impatient gesture, as if to address him, sprang a step
or two forward:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor creature! let us hear what she has to say,”
said Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, my dear Mrs. May,” replied Crayford,
with an effort at calmness, “I cannot submit you
to the importunities of that woman; is it possible you
have never seen her—it is Nell, the crazy fortune-teller!”
then throwing her a half dollar, accompanied
by a look which Florence did not observe, he passed
on with his lovely companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor creature! she should be taken care of!” exclaimed
Florence. Looking back, she saw the money
still glittering upon the pavement, while the girl, with
her form slightly bent forward, her arms extended before
her, and her small, thin hands clasped together,
seemed the very personification of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They soon reached the Academy. At the entrance
they encountered several persons, some entering, others
leaving the building. As they were ascending the
steps, a voice close to the ear of Florence, whispered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Beware of the serpent!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started and looked quickly around, but saw no
one to whom she could attribute the remark. An old
gentleman and lady were behind her, and with the exception
of a spruce, dandified individual, she could
discover no one else. It was sometime, however, ere
she could recover from the agitation into which this
had thrown her; and Crayford, attributing her abstraction
entirely to her pity for the poor fortune-teller,
exerted all his skill as a connoisseur to draw her attention
to the beautiful creations of the painter and
sculptor. He was successful, and the mind of Florence
soon engrossed alone by the pleasing objects around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times, in passing through the rooms, her eyes
encountered those of a gentleman dressed in deep
mourning, who seemed to be regarding her with a sad
and mournful gaze. At first she thought nothing of it;
but when again and again she met the same sad expressive
eyes, she could not suppress a feeling of
agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spent some hours here, and were about retiring,
when, in one of the galleries, Florence observed
the same gentleman standing at a little distance attentively
regarding a fine group of statuary. His profile
was turned toward them, and struck with the intellectual
cast of his features, Florence pointed him out
to Crayford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens, he here!” he exclaimed, as his eye fell
upon him, while a mortal paleness overspread his
features; then aware his agitation must appear singular
to his companion, he added, “I met that gentleman
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
abroad under circumstances of very strange interest;
some other time I will explain—if you please we will
now pass on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they reached the door Florence looked around,
but the stranger had disappeared. Once, as they
threaded their way homeward through the busy crowd,
she thought she met the same mournful eyes, but ere
she could take a second look they had vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Florence! what conflicting thoughts distressed
her when left to her own reflections, for notwithstanding
her resolution of the morning, her confidence in
Crayford began to be shaken, and that it was so
pained her. She longed for some kind, sympathizing
friend to whom she could confide her doubts, and who
would counsel her how to act. Among her few acquaintances
she <a id='knew'></a>knew of none capable of advising her,
and the good old woman who acted as her housekeeper,
although she loved her dear young mistress,
and would go to the ends of the earth to serve her,
could be of little assistance in a case like the present.
She did not love Crayford, yet she felt he was one
who had interested her more than any person she had
ever met with, one whom, perhaps, she might learn to
love; and then, should he prove the villain, should she
find that the warnings of the unknown were but too
true—what would be her fate! At one moment she
resolved to dismiss him forever from her presence, and
the next her heart accused her of prejudice and injustice.
Poor girl! never had she felt so unhappy as
when that night she rested her aching head upon her
pillow. Hark! what sweet music floats around her,
and insensibly yielding to its soothing power, she
sunk into a gentle, refreshing slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she awoke the sun was already glinting
bravely through the muslin window-shades, and with
a much lighter heart, she sprang from her couch.
Remembering she had invited Crayford to breakfast
with her, she hastily made her toilet. A small pleasure
party, acquaintances of Florence, had been formed
for Cape May. They were to start at an early hour,
and Crayford had so earnestly pleaded to make one
of the number, that finally she had consented. They
were to breakfast together, and then proceed to the
place of rendezvous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as Florence was about descending to the
breakfast-room, a note was handed her. She turned
pale as she took it, for she saw it was from the
unknown. With a trembling hand she broke the seal
and read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ere it may be too late, listen to the warning voice
of your friend. Let me arouse you from that pleasing
repose, which, like the calm preceding a tempest, lulls
you in such fancied security, let me bid you shun
Crayford—shun <span class='it'>him</span> whose breath would sully the
purity of an angel—shun him as you would the viper
in your path!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Florence finished reading, she sunk into a chair,
and covering her face with her hands, burst into
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Crayford is below, ma’am,” said a servant,
entering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! how should she act! There was a truth and
earnestness about the note she dared not disregard, and
a few moments’ reflection determined her to avoid him
until she could learn either the truth or falsehood of
these heavy accusations. She therefore bade the servant
say that a violent headache would preclude her
from joining the intended excursion—and she also sent
a note of the same purport to the lady manager of the
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments she saw Crayford leave the house.
Could she have read the thoughts then passing through
his mind, she would have found full confirmation of
her worst fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She now determined upon a bold step, and with
trembling hand addressed a note to her mysterious
counsellor:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are really my friend, why do you thus shun
me; why, if honest, thus clothe yourself in so much
mystery? What proof have you to give me of your
sincerity? Alas! I fear, none; and yet I would not
have it so, for the thought of your friendship has been
very pleasant to me! What reliance can I place upon
the assertions of one who thus shuns inquiry, against
the character of a person bearing the semblance of so
much worth as Crayford? I have a right to demand
proofs of what you have stated; and I now do so,
which, if you withhold, I shall deem all your accusations
against that individual as base forgeries. God
judge the right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This note she sealed, and ordering the servants to
inform her when the usual messenger from the unknown
should again appear, she sat down to reflect
upon the singular position in which she found herself
placed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until the following morning that Florence
had an opportunity to forward her note. From her
window she at length saw the lad coming down the
street with a basket of beautiful roses. She immediately
ran down, and as he rang the bell she opened
the door quickly, and placing the note in his hand, bade
him deliver it to his master. The next moment, how
gladly she would have recalled him, so imprudent appeared
to her the course she was pursuing. It was
too late, however—and in a state of much agitation
she now awaited the result. She had not to wait
long. In the course of an hour she received an answer
couched as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You demand proof, and you shall have it. Thank
God that you are sufficiently alarmed to ask it. Go,
then, to No. 7 —— Lane, and inquire for a Mrs.
Belmont. Be not dismayed at what is before you—shrink
not from a step which may save you from
wretchedness. Go, then, pure and lovely one, and
fear not. One will be near you who will protect you
with his life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>By her death-hour’s turbid river</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Stood her trembling soul;</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;By her anguish past control,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;By the hell which was her goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Dora Stilling was but six years old when
her best friend went to Heaven. She was a beautiful
child, and her father, Mark Stilling, an old engraver,
loved her with a species of blind idolatry. Stilling
was by birth a German, and his reading had not gone
much beyond the childish romances peculiar to his
country, which had left upon his mind an <a id='indel'></a>indelible
impression. At twelve years old he was apprenticed
to an engraver, and since that time had seen little of
the world beyond the room in which his noiseless occupation
happened to be. His mind, therefore, remained
half asleep, and the dreams that passed through
it had little in common with the real life around him.
He was an old man when he married, and his wife,
who passed with many, who did not know better, as
his daughter, died a few years after their only child,
Dora, was born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the death of his wife, the heart of Mark Stilling
turned toward the sweet child she had left him,
with an affection made jealous and intenser by his loss.
For her he desired all good in the world’s power to
bestow; but as to what was the greatest good he had
but vague notions. As he grew older, and his mind
drooped toward second childhood, from the ideas and
feelings of his earlier years the dust of time was blown
away, and all was as distinct and fresh as if the spring-time
of life were but yesterday. Images of beautiful
maidens, wooed by princes in disguise, floated before
his imagination; and then his thoughts would turn to
Dora, who grew more and more lovely in his eyes
every day. Nothing short of some such consummation
for his child, he felt, would ever satisfy him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was little wonder that the old engraver loved
Dora with an absorbing affection; for, opening like a
rose, she displayed to his eyes some new feature of
loveliness every day, as well in mind as in body.
While he sat at his work, tracing out upon the hard,
polished steel forms of beauty, Dora was ever present
in his mind, more beautiful than any creation of the
painter’s pencil he had yet been commissioned to copy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiftly the years glided on, and Dora became less
and less a child. As soon as she was able to go to
school, she was placed under the care of the best
teachers in the city, and from that time every dollar
earned by Stilling, beyond what the simple wants of
nature demanded, was spent upon his daughter, that
she might be thought accomplished in every thing, and
thus made a fit companion for the best in the land.
He wished her to be, in one word, a <span class='it'>lady</span>—and, in
the engraver’s mind, a lady was something more than
the term conveys in its usual acceptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Dora grew up lovely and accomplished as
her parent’s heart could desire, she exhibited a simplicity
of taste, and a love for useful employments, that
her father did not in the least approve. Fond old man!
Half insane, under the delusion himself had conjured
up from among his early fancies, he felt, whenever
Dora’s hands were engaged in work, that she was degrading
herself, and ever sought to keep her above the
necessity of entering into any domestic occupation.
Dora, as her mind grew clearer, saw the weakness
and folly of all this. She saw that her father was old,
and growing feebler and less able to work every day,
and that his income was steadily decreasing; and she
felt that, before a very long time, upon her would fall
the burden of his as well as her own support. One
day she came to him and said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear father, you are getting old, and your strength
is failing. Let me go and learn a trade, and then I can
work for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man caught for breath two or three times,
like one suddenly deprived of air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A trade, did you say, child!” He spoke in a low
whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, father, a trade. Let me learn some trade, so
that I can help you. I am young, and you are old.
You have worked for me since I was child; now let
me work for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Dora! You shall not learn a trade,” replied
Stilling firmly. Then he added, in a chiding
voice, “How could you think of such a thing! You
must look higher, my child. You are as good as any
lady in the land, and may take the place of the best.”
Here his voice grew animated. “Don’t you remember
the story of the light-haired maiden whom the
king’s son saw, and loved better than all the proud
court ladies, because she was beautiful and good; and
how he came in a splendid chariot, and carried her
away and made her his bride? True, there are no
kings here”—the old man faintly sighed—“but there
are many rich and great people. No—no—Dora, you
shall not learn a trade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora understood well what her father meant by
these allusions, for he had often talked so before, and
sometimes more plainly; and she knew that it would
be of no use to argue against him. So she said no
more about learning a trade. But she engaged more
diligently in every useful thing that came to her hand,
and sought, by every means in her power, to add to
her father’s comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost alone as Mark Stilling was, and possessing
none of those cultivated tastes and accomplishments
necessary for one who would introduce a young girl
like his daughter into society, the old man saw weeks
and months go by, after Dora had become a woman,
and yet his lovely flower remained hidden by the wayside.
He looked upon her as she came in and went
out, and wondered that all the world was not captivated
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
by her beauty. And as he grew older, and his
intellect became feebler and feebler, this one idea took
a still stronger hold upon his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora, at the age of nineteen, began to feel great concern
for her father. Both body and mind it was plain
to her were failing rapidly; and orders for work were
much less frequent than they had been. But even if
work had been as abundant as before, he had less
ability to perform it; and this was daily decreasing.
Again she asked permission to learn a trade; but it
was met with as firm an opposition as before, and on
the same ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have some means of supporting myself and
father,” she said thoughtfully to herself, “for it will
not be long that he can keep at work. What shall I
do? He will not let me learn a trade.” She reflected
for a long time, and then, as if all had become clear to
her, she clapped her hands together and murmured—“Yes—yes.
That shall be it. I will devote myself to
my music until I become proficient enough to teach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already much money had been expended on Dora’s
musical education, and she played and sang well.
But she was not skilled enough to be able to give instructions.
So from that time she spent many hours
each day at her piano; and also practiced on the guitar.
As the old man listened to her warblings, how little
dreamed he that all this was but the learning of a trade,
against which his mind had so revolted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we have said, the old man became less and less
competent to perform his work well and expeditiously,
and it gradually left him and went into other hands.
His income thus reduced, it became necessary to
abridge the expenses of his household, or fall in debt,
something for which Stilling had a natural horror.
The first step downward, and one that it hurt the engraver
much to take, was the giving up of the neat
little house in which he had lived, and taking apartments
in a second story, at half the rent formerly paid.
Dora urged strongly, when this change was made, to
have their domestic sent away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do all the work, father. Let Ellen go, and
then we will save nearly half our living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man would not listen a moment to this,
and silenced his daughter by an emphatic “No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet for all this care in keeping Dora above the
sphere of usefulness, her charms had not won for her
a distinguished lover. Still Dora had a lover, and this
was less wonderful than it would have been had her
sweet face not pictured itself on some heart. But her
lover was only a humble clerk in a store where she
had often been to make purchases. He was as simple
and earnest in all his tastes and feelings as Dora herself.
Their meetings were not frequent, for young
Edwards had been told of the old engraver’s weakness,
and did not, therefore, venture to call upon his
sweetheart at her home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length so little work came that Stilling did not
receive more than sufficient money to buy food, and
actual privation began to creep in upon himself and
daughter. Stern necessity required the dismissal of
their domestic, and then the old man busied himself in
household matters, in order to keep Dora as far as possible
above such menial employments. As age crept
on, and his intellects grew still weaker, he clasped his
fond delusion more closely to his heart, and observed
all of Dora’s movements with a more jealous eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For as long a time as a year had the faith of Dora
and her lover been pledged. Their meetings were
generally in the street, on a certain appointed afternoon
of each week. Then they walked together and talked
about the future, when there should be no barrier to
their happiness. But the young man, as time wore on,
grew impatient; and his pride occasionally awakened,
telling him that he was as good as the old engraver,
and worthy, in every respect, to claim the hand of his
daughter. Sometimes this feeling showed itself to
Dora, when the maiden would be so hurt that Edwards
always repented of his hasty words, and resolved to
be more guarded in future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me call and see you at your father’s,” said
Edwards, one day as they were walking together;
“perhaps I may not be so unwelcome a visiter as you
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no! you must not think of it,” replied
Dora quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where is this to end?” inquired the young
man. “If he will not accept me as your lover, and
you cannot become mine except with his consent, the
case seems hopeless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora did not reply at the moment, and they walked
along for some time in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a way. I have thought of it a great deal,”
at length said the young girl. She spoke with some
hesitation in her manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” inquired her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora leaned toward him, and said something in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not to be thought of,” was the quick reply
of the young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora was silent, while her bosom, as it rose and fell
quickly, showed that her feelings were much disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestion, whatever it was, appeared to hurt
or offend the young man, and when they separated, it
was with a coldness on his part that made tears dim
the eyes of Dora the moment she turned from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On their next meeting both felt constrained; and
their conversation was not so free and tender as before.
It took some weeks for the effect of Dora’s
proposition, whatever it was, to wear off. But after
that time the sunshine came back again, and was
brighter and warmer than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, it was perhaps four or five months after
the little misunderstanding just mentioned, the old engraver
was visited by a stranger, whose whole appearance
marked him as either a foreigner or one who
had lived abroad. He wanted him, he said, to copy
on steel, in his most finished style, the miniature of a
lady. As he mentioned his errand to the engraver, he
drew from his pocket the miniature of a young and
exquisitely beautiful woman, set in a costly gold locket.
Mark Stilling took the picture, but the moment he
looked at it his countenance changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not a beautiful face?” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen it before,” remarked the engraver,
with a thoughtful air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you?” was the quick inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
“Yes. But of whom is it a likeness?” asked the
old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of one,” said the stranger, “who has flitted before
me, of late, the impersonation of all that is lovely
in her sex. As she passes me in the street, I gaze
after her as one would gaze at an angel. A skillful
painter, at my request, has sketched her face, taking
feature after feature, as he could fix them, until, at
last, this image of beauty has grown under his pencil.
And now I want it transferred to steel, lest some accident
should deprive me of its possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the stranger thus spoke, Stilling sat gazing
upon the miniature with the air of one bound by a
spell. And no wonder—for it was the image of his
own child! and it seemed, as he looked into the pictured
face intently, as if the lips would part and the
voice of Dora fall upon his ears. Then he turned his
eyes upon the dignified, princely looking stranger, and
the thought came flashing through his mind that his
dream of years was about being realized. Dora was
the lovely unknown of whom he had spoken with so
much enthusiasm; with whom he was so passionately
enamored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you do the work for me?” said the stranger,
breaking in upon the old man’s revery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes,” answered Stilling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to do it well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take, then, your own time, and charge your own
price. Here are fifty dollars,” and the stranger handed
the engraver some money. “I will call every day
while the work is progressing, that I may look at the
sweet picture upon which you are engaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How large shall it be?” inquired the engraver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the size of the miniature,” replied the stranger.
Then rising, he said, as he bowed to Stilling, “I will
see you again to-morrow about this hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day, when the stranger called, Dora
was sitting by her father. An exclamation of delight
was checked upon his lips, as his eyes fell upon the
beautiful girl; but his noble face expressed surprise
and undisguised admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lovely original!” dropped at length from his
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter,” said the engraver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora rose up and made a low courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your daughter! How strange! You did not tell
me this yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But she is my child—my only child—and I
love her better than I love my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light kindled in the old man’s face, and a quiver of
excitement was in every nerve. It was only by an
effort that he refrained from giving way to the most
extravagant praises of Dora, who sat, with her eyes
meekly cast upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day, the stranger called again, and found
Dora, as at the previous visit, with her father. This
time he spoke to the maiden in a familiar, yet respectful
way. Every look he directed toward her was one
of admiration; yet not a glance of this character
escaped the watchful eyes of her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the first Mark Stilling regarded the stranger
with especial favor. After the meeting with Dora it
was settled in the old man’s mind that fortune was at
length to crown with joy his dearest wish in life. All
suspicion was lulled to rest in his mind. The fact that
the stranger withheld his name, but confirmed him in
the belief that he was either a nobleman in disguise, or
connected with some wealthy and distinguished family
at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Week followed week, and the stranger came every
day to mark the progress of the plate, the execution of
which he did not countermand. He never staid over
an hour at a time, and that was mostly spent with
Dora, whose musical abilities he highly praised, and
whom he always asked to play for him. The little
parlor of the engraver was on a different floor from
that on which he worked, and so, while playing for
the stranger, Dora was always alone with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stilling was in no way surprised when the stranger
asked the hand of his daughter in marriage. Dora
was born to be a lady, and now had come the fufillment
of her destiny. The poor old man’s mind was
so infirm that it could not go beyond this simple idea.
No doubt came to trouble him; no suspicion disturbed
his happy dream. More than the stranger told him
he believed; for as to who he was, or to what station
Dora would be elevated, he was silent. But Stilling
asked nothing on this head. He believed all he wished
to believe. The offer for his child’s hand he felt to
be a noble offer, and he yielded his fullest consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so Dora was married to the stranger. But not
until five minutes before the ceremony was performed,
did Stilling know that his name was <span class='it'>Edwards</span>. The
marriage took place in Stilling’s little parlor. After
the rite was over, and the minister had retired, the
bridegroom took the old man’s hand, and said to him,
as he pointed to the finished plate containing the head
of Dora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, father, is your last work. You can rest
now after so many years of labor. Come, there is a
carriage at the door; we will go to our new home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stilling was half bewildered, yet happy. Without
a pause or objection, he suffered his children to take
him to another home. That home was really a modest
one; but in the eyes of the fond old man it was little
less than a palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning after the marriage, the moustache
of young Edwards disappeared, and he went forth
daily from that time and engaged in his regular business.
But the engraver, who now began to sink
rapidly both in mind and body, dreamed not that Dora’s
husband was only a clerk, whose yearly income fell
below a thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than a year Mark Stilling slept with his
fathers, deeply mourned by the child he had loved
with so strong and blind a passion. He was ignorant
to the last of the deceit that had been practiced upon
him, and as firmly believed that the kind and affectionate
young husband of Dora was of noble blood,
and one of the great ones of the land, as that the sun
arose and set daily. And he was far happier in this
belief than he would have been with all as real as he
imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus passed the afternoon, until the evening meal
was announced, and Jasper was left alone, with nothing
but his own wild and whirling thoughts to entertain
him. He was ill at ease in his own mind, ill at
ease with himself and with all around him. Vexed
with Durzil Bras-de-fer, for offering in the first instance
to take him as a partner in his adventure, and then for
failing at the pinch to back his offer by his stout
opinion; vexed with his father for thwarting his will,
and yet more for rebuking him publicly, and in the
presence of Theresa, too, before whom, boy-like, he
would fain have figured as a hero; and lastly, vexed
with Theresa herself, because, though kind and gentle,
she had not sat by his bedside all day, as she did yesterday,
or devoted all her attention to himself alone,
he was in the very mood to torment himself, and
every one else, to the extent of his powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as his thoughts wandered from one to another
of those whom he thought fit to look upon as
having wronged him, they settled on the most innocent
of all, Theresa; and, at the same moment, the
wild words, which he had uttered without any ulterior
meaning at the time, and with no other intent than
that of annoying his father, recurred to his mind, concerning
village maidens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started, as the idea recurred to him, and at first
he wondered what train of thought could have brought
back those words in connection with Theresa’s image.
But, as he grew accustomed to his own thought, it
became, as it were, the father to the wish; and he
began to consider how pretty and gentle she was, and
how delicate her slight, rounded figure, and how soft
and low her voice. Then he remembered that she
had looked at him twice or thrice during the day, with
an expression which he had never seen in a woman’s
eye before, and which, though he understood it not,
did not bode ill to his success; and lastly, the worst,
bitterest thought of all arose in his mind, and retained
possession of it. “I will spite them all,” he thought,
“that proud, insolent young sailor, who, because he
is a few years older than I, and has seen swords
drawn once or twice—for all, I doubt if he can fence
or shoot any better than I, or if he be a whit more active—affects
to look down upon me as a stripling.
His young friend, truly! let him look out, whether he
have not cause to term me something else ere he die.
By God! I believe he loves the girl, too! he looked
black as a thunder-cloud over Dartmoor, when she
smiled on me! And my father—by my soul! I think
he’s doting; and her dainty ladyship, too! I’ll see if I
cannot have her more eager to hear me, than she has
shown herself to-day. I will do it—I will, by all that’s
holy! Heaven! how it will spite them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he laid his head down on the pillow, and
began to reflect how he should act, and what were his
chances of success in the villainy which he meditated;
and he even asked himself, with something of the
boy’s diffidence in his first encounter with woman,
“but can I, can I win her affection?” and vanity and
the peculiar audacity of his race, of his own character,
made answer instantly, “Ay, can I? Am I not handsomer,
and cleverer, and more courtly; am I not
higher born and higher bred, and higher mannered,
not only than that seafaring lout, but than any one she
has ever met withal? Ay, can I, and ay, will I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in obedience to this last and base resolve, the
worst and barest that ever had crossed the boy’s mind,
no sooner had they returned from the adjoining room,
after the conclusion of the evening meal, than he contrived
entirely to monopolize Theresa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, he asked her to play at chess with him; and
then, after spending a couple of hours, under the pretence
of playing, but in reality gazing into her blue
eyes, and talking all sorts of wild, enthusiastical,
poetical romance, half earnest and half affected, he declared
that his head ached, and asked her to read aloud
to him; and when she did so, sitting without a thought
of ill beside his pillow, while their fathers were conversing
in a low tone over the hearth, and Durzil was
absent making his preparations for the next day’s
journey, he let his hand fall, as if unconsciously, on
hers, and after a little while, emboldened by her unsuspicious
calmness, imprisoned it between his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might have been that she was so much engrossed
in reading, for it was Shakspeare’s sweet Rosalind
that the boy had chosen for her subject, that she was
not aware that her hand was clasped in his. It might
have been, that, accustomed to its pressure, from his
involuntary retention of it during his lethargic sleep on
the preceding day, she let it pass as a matter of no consequence.
It might have been, that almost unsuspected
by herself, a feeling of interest and affection,
which might easily be ripened into love, was already
awakened in her bosom, for the high-spirited, handsome,
fearless boy, who in some measure owed his
life to her assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all events, she made no effort to withdraw it,
but let it lie in his, passive, indeed, and motionless,
save for its quivering pulse, but warm and soft and
sensitive. And the boy waxing bolder, and moved
into earnestness by the charms of the position, ventured
to press it once or twice, as she read some moving
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
line, and murmured praises of the author’s beauties, and
of the sweet, low voice that lent to those beauties a more
thrilling loveliness, and still the fairy fingers were not
withdrawn from his hold, though her eye met not his,
nor any word of hers answered his whispered praises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length a quick, strong step came suddenly to the
door of the room, and almost before there was time for
thought, the door was thrown open, and Durzil Olifaunt
entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly Theresa started at the sound, and strove to
withdraw her hand, while a deep blush of shame and
agitation crimsoned her cheeks and brow, and even
overspread her snowy neck and bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not, as that bold boy fancied at the time, in the
vanity and insolence of his uncorrected heart, that she
knew all the time, that she was allowing what it was
wrong, and immodest, and unmaidenly to endure, and
that now she was afraid and ashamed, not of the error,
but of the detection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. In the perfect purity of her heart, in the half
pitiful, half protecting spirit which she felt toward
Jasper, first as an invalid, and then as a mere boy—for
although he was, perhaps, a year her senior, who
does not know that boys in their eighteenth year are a
full lustre younger than girls of the same age—she had
thought nothing, dreamed nothing of impropriety in
yielding her hand to the boy’s affectionate grasp, until
the step of the man, whose proffered love she had
that very day declined, led her to think intuitively what
would be <span class='it'>his</span> feelings, and thence what must be Jasper’s,
concerning that permitted license.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the wily boy, for, so young as he was, he lacked
neither sagacity to perceive, nor audacity to profit by
occasion, saw his advantage, and holding his prize with
a gentle yet firm pressure, without so much as turning
his eyes to Durzil, or letting it be known that he was
aware of his presence, raised it to his lips, and kissed
it, saying, in a low, earnest tone,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, from my very soul, for your gentleness
and kind attention, dearest lady; your sweet voice
has soothed me more than words can express; there
must be a magic in it, for it has charmed my headache
quite away, and divested me, moreover, from the least
desire to seek glory, or <a id='glory'></a>the gallows, with your bold
cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of Durzil Bras-de-fer flashed fire, as he saw,
as he heard what was passing; and he made two or
three strides forward, with a good deal of his old impetuosity,
both of look and <a id='gest'></a>gesture. His brow was
knitted, his hands clinched, and his lip compressed over
his teeth, so closely that it was white and bloodless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But happily—or perhaps, unhappily—before he had
time to commit himself, he saw Theresa withdraw her
hand so decidedly, and with so perfect a majesty of
gentle yet indignant womanhood, gazing upon the audacious
offender, as she did so, with eyes so full of
wonder and rebuke, that he could not doubt the
sincerity or genuineness of her anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acquitting her, therefore, of all blame or coquetry,
and, looking upon Jasper as a mere boy, and worthy to
be treated as such only, reflecting, moreover, that he
was for the time being, shielded by his infirmity, he
controlled himself, though not without an effort, and
with a lip now curling scornfully, and an eye rather
contemptuous than angry, advanced to the fireside, and
took his seat beside his uncle and Sir Miles, without
taking the slightest notice of the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, Theresa, after she had disengaged
her hand from Jasper, and cast upon him that one look
of serene indignation, turned her back on him quietly,
in spite of some attempt at apology or explanation
which he began to utter. Walking slowly and composedly
to the table, she laid down on it the volume of
Shakspeare which she had been reading to him, and
selecting some implements of feminine industry, moved
over to the group assembled round the hearth, and sat
down on a low footstool, between Durzil and her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one but the two young men and herself were
aware what had passed; and she, though annoyed by
Jasper’s forwardness, having, as she thought, effectually
repelled it, had already dismissed it from her
mind as a thing worth no further consideration. Durzil,
on the other hand, though attaching far more importance
to his action, saw plainly that this was not the
time or the place for making any comment on it, even
if he had been capable of adding to Theresa’s embarrassment;
while Jasper, mortified and frustrated by
the lady’s scornful self-possession, and the free-trader’s
manifest contempt, had no better mode of concealing
his disappointment, than by sinking back upon his
pillow, as if fatigued or in pain, and feigning to fall
gradually asleep—a feint which, as is oftentimes the
case, terminated at last in reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the two old men continued to talk
quietly, in rather a subdued tone, of old times and the
events of their youth, and thence of the varied incidents
which had checkered their lives, during the long
space of time since they had been friends and comrades,
with many a light and shadow. And as they,
garrulous, as is the wont of the aged and infirm, and
“<span class='it'>laudatores temporis acti</span>,” found pleasure even in
the retrospect on things, which in their day were
painful, the young man sat beside them silent, oppressed
with the burthen of present pain, and yet more
by the anticipation of worse suffering to be endured
thereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly an hour passed thus, without a single word
being exchanged between Durzil and Theresa; he
musing deeply, with his head buried in his hands, as
he bent over the embers of the wood fire, which the
vicinity of the cottage to the water’s edge rendered
agreeable even on summer evenings, and she plying
her needle as assiduously as if she were dependent on
its exercise for her support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times, indeed, she looked up at him with her
candid, innocent face, and her beautiful blue eye clear
and unclouded, as if she wished to catch his attention.
But he was all unconscious of her movement, and continued
to ponder gloomily on many things that had,
and yet more that had not, any existence beyond the
limits of his own fitful fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length tired of waiting for his notice, the rather
that the night was wearing onward, she arose from
her seat, folding up her work as she did so, and laid
her hand lightly on her cousin’s shoulder⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
“And are you really going to leave us to-morrow,
Durzil?” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a few days only,” he answered, raising his
head, and meeting her earnest eye with a cold, sad
smile. “I am going to ride down to-morrow afternoon
as far as Hexwerthy, where I will sleep, and so
get into Plymouth betimes the following day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when shall you come back to us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not stay an hour longer than I can avoid,
Theresa; and I think that in three days I may be able
to arrange all that I have to do; if so, you may look
for me within the week—at furthest, I shall be here in
ten days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how long may we count on keeping you here,
then? It will be long, I fear, before we shall meet
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ship cannot be fit for sea within three weeks,
Theresa, or it may be a month; and I shall stay here,
be sure, until the last moment. But as all mortal
matters are uncertain to a proverb, and as none of us
can say when, or if ever, we shall meet again, and as
I have much to say to you before I go to sea this time,
will you not walk in the garden with me for an hour
before breakfast to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely I will. How can you doubt it, Durzil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not doubt it. And then I can give you my
opinion about the young nightingales, which we forgot,
after all, this morning. I dare say they will turn out to
be hedge sparrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be there soon after the sun is up, Durzil,
and that I may be so, good-night, all,” and with the
word, kissing her father’s brow, and giving her hand
affectionately to Durzil, she courtesied to the old cavalier,
and left the room without so much as looking
toward Jasper, who was, however, already fast asleep,
and unconscious of all sublunary matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her rising, though she had not joined in the conversation
for the last hour or more, broke up the company, and
in a few minutes they had all withdrawn, each to his
own apartment; and Jasper was left alone, with the
brands dying out one by one on the hearth-stone, and
an old tabby cat dozing near the andirons; this night
he had no other watchers, and none were there
to hear or see what befell him during the hours of
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But had there been any one present in that old apartment,
he would have seen that the sleep of the young
man was strangely restless and perturbed, that the
sweat-drops stood in large cold beads upon his brow,
that his features were from time to time fearfully distorted,
as if by pain and horror, and that he tossed his
arms to and fro, as if he were wrestling with some
powerful but intangible oppressor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From time to time, moreover, he uttered groans
and strangely murmured sounds, and a few articulate
words; but these so unconnected, and at so long intervals
asunder, that no human skill could have combined
them into any thing like intelligible sentences.
At length with a wild, shrill cry, he started up erect
in his bed, his hair bristling with terror, and the cold
sweat flowing off his face like rain-drops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God!” he cried, “avert—defend! Horror!
horror!” Then raising his hands slowly to his brow,
he felt himself, grasped his arm, and sought for the
pulsations of his heart, as if he were laboring to satisfy
himself that he was awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, he murmured, “It was a dream! The
Lord be praised! it was but a dream! and yet, how
terrible, how vivid. Even now, I can scarce believe
that I was not awake and saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as his eye ran over the objects to which it had
become accustomed during the last days, and which
were now indistinctly visible in the glimmering darkness
of a fine summer night, he became fully satisfied
that he had been indeed asleep; and with a muttered
prayer, he settled himself down again on the pillow,
and composed himself to sleep once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not slept, however, above half an hour before
the same painful symptoms recurred; and after
even a longer and more agonizing struggle than the
first, he again woke, panting, horror-stricken, pale and
almost paralyzed with superstitious terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was!” he gasped, “it was—it must have been
reality. I saw her, as I did last night, tangible, face
to face; but, oh God! what a glare of horror in those
beautiful blue eyes—what a gory spot on that smooth,
white brow—what agony—what supplication in every
lovely feature. And he, he who dealt the blow—I
could not see the face, but the dress, the figure, nay,
the seat on horseback—great God! they were all mine
own!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused for a long time, meditating deeply, and
casting furtive glances around the large old-fashioned
room, as though he expected to see some of the great
heavy shadows which brooded in the dim angles and
irregular recesses of the walls, detach themselves
from their lurking places, in the guise of human forms
disembodied, and come forth to confront him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, however, his naturally strong intellect
and characteristic audacity led him to discard the idea
of supernatural influence in the appalling vision, which
had now twice so cruelly disturbed him. Still,
so great had been the suffering and torture of his
mind during the conflict of the sleeping body and the
sleepless intellect, that he actually dreaded the return
of slumber, lest that dread phantom should return with
it; and he therefore exerted himself to keep awake,
and to arm his mind against the insidious stealing on
of sleep, from very fear of what should follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the very efforts which he made to banish the
inclination, wearied the mind, and induced what he
would most avoid; and within an hour he was again
unconscious of all external sights and sounds, again
terribly alive to those inward sensations which had
already terrified him almost beyond endurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time the trance was shorter, but from the symptoms
which appeared on his features, fiercer and
stronger than before; nor, as before, when he awoke,
did the impression pass away which had been made
on him before his eyes were opened. No; as he
started up erect, and gazed wildly, scarce as yet half
awake, around him, the first thing that met, or seemed
to meet, his staring eyes, was a gray, misty shadow,
standing relieved by a dark mass of gloom in the
farthest angle of the chamber. Gradually, as he stared
at it with a fascinated gaze, which, had it been to
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
save his life, he could not have withdrawn, the shape,
if shape it were, drew nearer, nearer, with a slow,
gliding, ghastly motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon had by this time arisen, and cast a feeble,
ineffectual light through the mass of tangled foliage
which curtained the large diamond-paned casements of
the cottage, streaming in a dim, misty ray across the
centre of the chamber. Directly in the middle of this
pallid halo, as if it had been a silver glory, paused, or
appeared to pause, that thin transparent form—so
bodiless, indeed, it seemed, that the outlines of the
things which stood beyond it, were visible, as if seen
through a gauzy curtain. A cloud passed over the
moon’s face, and all was gloom; yet still the boy’s
eyes <span class='it'>felt</span> the presence of that disembodied visitant,
which they could now no longer distinguish in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment, as if to add a real terror to that
which, even if unreal, needed no addition, the cat,
which hitherto had been sleeping undisturbedly by the
warm ashes on the hearth, uttered an unusual plaintive
cry, most unlike to the natural note of her species,
whether of pleasure or of anger, and rushed at two or
three long bounds, to the bed on which the boy was
sitting up in voiceless horror. Her eyes glared in the
darkness, like coals of livid fire, her bristles were set
up like the quills of the porcupine, her tail was outspread,
till it almost resembled a fox’s brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cloud drifted onward, and the moon shone out
brighter than before; and there he still saw, that tall
white shape, clearer, distincter, stronger than when
he first beheld it. The cat cowered down upon the
pillow by his side, with a low wailing cry of terror,
her back, bristling in wrath but now, was humbly
lowered, dread of something unnatural had quelled
all her savage instincts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearer and clearer waxed the vision, and now he
might mark the delicate symmetrical proportions of the
figure, and now the pale white outlines of the lovely
face. It <span class='it'>was</span> Theresa Allan. Yet the fair features
were set in a sort of rigid cataleptic horror, full of
dread, full of agony and consternation; and the blue
eyes glared, fixed and glassy, without speculation; and
right in the centre of the brow there glowed, like a
sanguine star, a great spot of gore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing seemed to raise its arm, and point with
a gesture of majestic menace, right toward the terrified
beholder. Then the white lips were parted with a
slow circular distortion, showing the pearly teeth
within, and——if a voice came forth from those
ghastly lips, Jasper St. Aubyn knew it not, for he had
sunk back on his pillow—if, indeed, he had ever, as he
believed to the day of his death, raised himself up
from it—in a deep trance, from which he passed into
a dead, heavy, dreamless stupor, which continued undisturbed
until the sun was high in the heavens, and
the whole household were afoot, and busied about
their usual avocations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, she whose image, whether in truth
it was <span class='it'>an eidolon</span>, or merely the idea of a diseased
mind and preoccupied spirit, had been so busy during
the hours of darkness, had awakened all refreshed by
light and innocent slumbers, with the first peep of day,
and arising from her couch had descended into the
garden, still half enveloped in the dewy vapors of the
summer night, half glimmering in the slant radiance of
the new-risen sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was the first at her appointment, for Durzil had
not yet made his appearance, and she walked to and
fro awaiting him, among the flowery thickets and
sweet scented shrubberies all bathed in the copious
night-dews, half wondering, half-guessing, what it
could be that he should so earnestly desire to communicate.
And as she walked, she considered with
herself all that had <a id='occ'></a>occurred during the last three days,
and the more she considered, the less was she able to
comprehend the workings of her own mind, or to explain
to herself wherefore it was that she could not
divest herself of the idea that the crisis of her life, the
fate of her heart was at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That she had rejected Durzil’s proffered love, his
honest, manly love, she knew that she ought not to
regret, for she felt surely that she could not love him
in return as he ought, as he deserved to be loved; and
yet she did almost regret it. Then she began to ask
herself why she did not, why she <span class='it'>could</span> not love him,
endowed eminently as he was with many high and
noble qualities; and she was soon answered, when she
considered how far he fell short of her standard, in
mental and intellectual culture, in all that pertained to
the secret sympathies of the heart, to the kindred tastes
and sentiments, to that community of hopes and wishes,
which, under the head of <span class='it'>eadem velle atque nolle</span>, the
Roman philosophical historian has declared to be the
sole base of true friendship, might he not better have
said of true love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thence by an easy and natural transition the girl’s
thoughts turned to the young stranger—to his magnificent
person and striking intellectual beauty—to his
singular and original character, so audacious, so full of
fiery and rebellious self-will, so confident in his own
powers, so daring, almost insolent toward man, and
yet, at the same time, so fraught with gentle and romantic
fancies, so rapt by romance or poetry, so liable
to all swift impressions of the senses, so humble, yet
with so proud and self-arrogating a humility toward
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought of the tones of his beautifully modulated
voice, of the expression of his deep, clear, gray
eye; she remembered how the one had melted, as it
were, almost timorously in her ear, how the other had
dwelt almost boldly on her face, yet with a boldness
which seemed meant almost as homage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mused on these things; and then paused to reflect
how helplessly and deathfully he had lain at her
feet, when he was drawn forth from that deep red
whirlpool; and how so sickly those fine eyes swam
when she first beheld them. How small a thing would
have extinguished, and forever, the faint spark of life
which then feebly fluttered in his bosom; how child-like
he had yielded himself to her ministration, and
with how piteous yet grateful an expression he had
acknowledged, when he awoke from his first trance-like
stupor, midway as it were between life and death,
the gentleness of her protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most true it is, that pity is akin to love; where pity,
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
as is seldom the case from woman toward man, can
exist apart from something approaching to contempt;
where it is called forth by the consequences neither of
physical nor mental weakness. Still more is it the
province and the part of woman to love whom they
have protected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With both sexes, I believe that to have conferred,
rather than to have received kindness—to be owed
rather than to owe gratitude—is conducive to the
growth of kindly feeling, of friendship, of affection,
love! But with a true woman, to have been dependent
on her for support, to have looked up into her eyes
for aid on the sick-bed, for sympathy in mortal sorrow,
to have revived by her nursing, to have been consoled
by her comforting—these are the truest and most direct
key to her affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theresa thought of all these things, and as she did
so, her bosom heaved almost unconsciously a sigh,
and a tear rose unbidden to her eye. She almost loved
Jasper St. Aubyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, the recollection of his boldness on the previous
evening, of his half forcible seizure of her hand,
of the kiss he had so daringly imprinted on her soft
fingers, of the too meaning words which he had addressed
to her, and of the tone, which conveyed even
more of consciousness and confidence than the words
themselves, all rushed at once upon her mind; and,
though she was alone, she started, and her face crimsoned
at the mere memory of what she half felt as an
indignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And could he think me,” she murmured to herself,
“so light, so vain, so easy to be won, that he dare
treat me thus at almost a first interview? or was it
but the rashness, the imprudence, the buoyancy of
extreme youth, inspired by sudden love, and encouraged
by his own headstrong character.” She paused a moment,
and then said almost aloud, “Oh, no, no, I will
not believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what will you not believe, Theresa?” said a
clear, firm voice, close behind her, “what is it that
you are so energetically determined not to believe, my
pretty cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started, not well pleased that even Durzil should
have thus, as it were, stolen upon her privacy, and
overheard what was intended for no mortal ear. Theresa
was as guileless as any being of mortal mould
may be; but even the most artless woman cannot be
altogether free from some touch of instinctive artifice—that
innocent and gentle guile is to woman what
nature has bestowed on all, even the humblest of its
creatures, her true weapon of defence, her shield
against the brute tyranny of man. And Theresa was
a woman. She replied, therefore, without an instant’s
hesitation, although her voice did falter somewhat, and
her cheeks burn, as she spoke⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you are angry with me, cousin Durzil.” But
then, as she felt his cold, clear, dark eye how piercingly
it dwelt upon her features, reading, or striving
to read, her very soul, she continued, seeing at once
the necessity of placing him on the defensive, so as to
turn the tide of aggressive warfare, “but <span class='it'>I</span> am angry
with <span class='it'>you</span>, I assure you; nor do I think it at all like
you, Durzil, or at all like a true cavalier, as you pretend
to be, first to keep a lady waiting for you, I don’t
know how long, here alone, and then to creep upon
her, like an Indian, or a spy, and surprise what little
secrets she might be turning over in her own mind.
You must have trodden lightly on purpose, or I should
have heard your step. I did not look for this at your
hand, cousin Durzil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He still gazed at her with the same dark, fixed,
piercing glance, without answering her a word; and,
although conscious of no wrong, she met his gaze with
her calm, candid, truthful eye, she could not endure
his suspicious look, but was fluttered, and blushed
deeply, and was so much embarrassed, that had not
pride and anger come to her aid, she would have burst
into tears. But they did come to her aid, and she
cried with a quivering voice and a flashing eye⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what do you look at me so, Durzil? I do not
like it—I will not bear it! You have no right to treat
me thus! it is not kind, nor courteous, nor even manly!
If it be to brow-beat me, and tyrannize over me, that
you asked me to meet you here, I could have thanked
you to spare me the request. But I shall leave you to
yourself, and return home; and so, good-morrow to
you, and better breeding, and a better heart, too,
cousin Durzil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though she said she was going, she made no
movement to do so, but hesitated, waiting for his
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be greatly changed, Theresa,” he said
bitterly, “to take offence at so slight a cause, or to
speak to me in such a tone. But you <span class='it'>are</span> greatly
changed, and there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not changed at all,” replied the girl, still
chafing at the recollection of that scrutinizing eye,
which she perhaps felt the more, because conscious
that her own reply had not been perfectly sincere.
“But I do not allow your right to pry meanly into my
secret thoughts, or to catechise me concerning my
words, or to accuse me of falsehood, when I answer
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accuse you of falsehood, Theresa! Who ever
dreamed of doing so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your eye did so, sir,” she replied. “When I told
you that I was determined ‘not to believe that you
were angry with me,’ you fixed your glance upon me
with the expression of a pedagogue, who having
caught a child lying would terrify it into truth. I am
no child, I assure you, Durzil, nor are you <span class='it'>yet</span> my
master. Think as you may about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now Durzil’s turn to be confused, for he
could not deny that she had construed the meaning of
his look aright; and would not, so proud was he and
so resolute, either deny or apologize for what was certainly
an act of rudeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s pause, however, he looked up at
her from under downcast eyelids, with a look of defiance
mingled with distrust, and answered bluntly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not believe that <span class='it'>was</span> your meaning, or that
you were thinking about me at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what if it were not? Am I bound, I pray
you, to be thinking of nothing but you? I must have
little enough to think of, if it were so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might at least have told me so much frankly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
“I thank you, cousin Durzil,” she made answer,
more proudly, more firmly than ever he had heard her
speak before. “I thank you, for teaching me a lesson,
though neither very kindly, nor exactly as a generous
gentleman should teach a lady. But you are perfectly
correct in your surmises, sir. I was <span class='it'>not</span> thinking of
you at all; no more, sir, than if you were not in existence,
and if I answered you, as I did, sir, <span class='it'>falsely</span>—yes!
<span class='it'>falsely</span> is the word!—it is because, in the first
place, you had no right to ask me the question you
did, and, in the second, because I did not choose to
answer it! Now, cousin, allow <span class='it'>me</span> to teach you
something—for you have something yet to learn, wise
as you are, about us women. If you ask a lady unmannerly
questions, hereafter, and she turn them off
by a flippant joke, or an unmeaning <span class='it'>falsehood</span>, understand
that <span class='it'>you</span> have been very rude, and that she does
not wish to be so likewise, by rebuking your impertinence.
Now, do you comprehend me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly, madam, perfectly. You have made
marvelous strides of late, upon my honor! Yesterday
morning an unsophisticated country maiden—this
morning a courtly, quick-witted, manœuvring, fine
lady! God send you, much good of the change,
though I doubt it. I can see all, read all, plainly
enough now—poor Durzil Bras-de-fer is not high
enough, I trow, for my dainty lady! Perchance, when
he is farther off, he may be better liked, and more
needed. At all events, I did not look for this at your
hands, Theresa, on the last morning, too, that we shall
spend together for so long a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Angry as she was, and indignant at the dictatorial
manner he had assumed toward her, these last words
disarmed her in a moment. A tear rose to her eyes,
and she held out her hand to him kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, Durzil,” she said, “and I was
wrong to be so angry. But you vexed me, and
wounded me by your manner. I am sorry; I ought
to have remembered that you were going to leave us,
and that you have some cause to be grieved and irritable.
Pardon me, Durzil, and forget what I said
hastily. We must not quarrel, for we have no friends
save one another, and my dear old father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Durzil’s was no placable mind, nor one that
could divest itself readily of a preconceived idea.
“Oh!” he replied, “for that, fair young ladies never
lack friends. For every old one they cast off they
win two new ones. See, if it be not so, Theresa. Is
it not so with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him reproachfully, but softly, and then
burst into tears. “You are ungenerous,” she said,
“ungenerous. But all men, I suppose, are alike in
this—that they can feel no friendship for a woman.
So long as they hope for her love, all is submission on
their part, and humility, and gentleness, and lip-service—once
they cannot win that, all is bitterness and persecution.
I did not look for this at <span class='it'>your</span> hand! But
<span class='it'>I</span> will not quarrel with you, Durzil. I dealt frankly
with you yester morning; I have dealt affectionately
with you ever; I will deal tenderly and forgivingly
with you now. I only wish that you had not
sought this interview with me, the only object of which
appears to have been the embittering the last hours of
our intercourse, and the endeavoring to wring and
wound my heart. But I⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had dealt frankly with me,” he interrupted
her, very angrily, “you would have told me honestly
that you loved another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loved another! What do you mean? What
other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So evident was the truth, the sincerity of her astonishment,
that jealousy itself was rebuked and put to
silence in the young man’s bosom; and he endeavored
to avoid or change the subject. But the womanly indignation
of the fair girl was now awakened; her
pride had been touched; her delicacy wounded; her
sensibilities availed in the tenderest point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me!” she said, after a little pause, during
which she, in her turn gazing upon him, now bewildered
and abashed, with eyes of serene wonder, not
all unmingled with contempt—“Nay! not another
word—leave me—begone! You are not worthy of a
woman’s love—you are not worthy to be treated or
regarded as a man. Leave me, I say, and trouble me
no more. Poor, weak, mean-spirited, vain, jealous,
and ungenerous, begone! You know—no man knows
better—the falsehood of the last words you have
spoken. No man knows better their unfeelingness,
their ungenerous cruelty. But if I had—if I had loved
another—in what does that concern you? In what am
I responsible to you for my likings or dislikings? Once
and for all be it said, I love you not—should not love
you, were you the only one of your sex on the face of
God’s earth—and I pray God to help and protect the
woman who shall love you—if ever you be loved of
woman, which I for one believe not—for she shall
love the veriest tyrant that ever tortured a fond heart,
under the plea of loving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go,” he replied. “I am answered, once and for
all. I go, and may <span class='it'>you</span> never need my aid, my forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgiveness!” she exclaimed, with a contemptuous
glance. “Forgiveness! I know not what <span class='it'>you</span>
have to forgive! But you should rather pray that I
<span class='it'>may</span> have need of them; then may <span class='it'>you</span> have the pleasure
of refusing me at my need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! it is thus you think of me. It is time, then,
that I should leave you. Fare you well, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need for farewells at present. The
day is early yet; and I trust still to see your temper
changed before you set forth on your journey. It
would grieve my father sorely that you should leave
us thus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will not know how I leave you. He will see
me no more for years—perhaps never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I shall mount my horse within this half hour,
and return no more until I shall have twice crossed the
Atlantic. So fare you well, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fare you well, Durzil, if it must be so. And God
bless you, and send you a better mind. You will be
sorry for this one day. There is my hand, fare you
well; and rest assured of this, return when you may,
you will find me the same Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand, and wrung it hard. “Farewell,”
he said. “Farewell; and God grant that when I do
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
return, I find you the wife, and not the mistress, of
Jasper St. Aubyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ungenerous and bitter to the last, he winged the
shaft at random, which he hoped would pierce the
deepest, which he trusted would prevent the consummation
he most dreaded—that she <span class='it'>should be</span> the wife
of the boy whom he had saved, whom he now hated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other contingency, at which he had hinted
basely, unmanly, brutally, he knew to be impossible—but
he knew also, that the surmise would gall her
beyond endurance. That, that was the cruel, the unworthy
object of the last words Durzil Bras-de-fer
ever exchanged in this world with Theresa Allan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned on his heel, and, without looking back
once, strode through the garden, with all his better
feelings lost and swallowed up in bitterness and hatred;
entered his own apartment, and there wrote a few
lines to his uncle, to the effect that in order to avoid
the pain of a parting, and the sorrows of a last adieu,
he had judged it for the wisest to depart suddenly and
unawares; and that he should not return to Widecomb
until his voyage should be ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, leaving the house, where he had passed so
many a happy hour, in hot and passionate resentment,
he mounted his horse and rode away at a hard gallop
across the hills toward Hexwerthy and Plymouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last words he uttered had gone to Theresa’s
heart like a death-shot. She did not speak, or even
sigh, as she heard them, but pressed her hand hard on
her breast, and fell speechless and motionless on the
dewy greensward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, engrossed by his selfish rage, and deafened to
the sound of her fall by the beatings of his own hard
heart, stalked off unconscious what had befallen her;
and she lay there, insensible, until the servant girl,
missing her at the breakfast hour, found her there cold,
and, as at first she believed, lifeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She soon revived, indeed, from the swoon; but the
excitement and agitation of that scene brought on a
slow, lingering fever; and weeks elapsed ere she again
left her chamber. When she did quit it, the fresh
green leaves of summer had put on their sere and yellow
hue, the autumn flowers were fast losing their
last brilliancy, the hoar-frosts lay white, in the early
mornings, over the turf walks of her garden, ice had
been seen already on the great pool above the fords of
Widecomb, and every thing gave notice that the dreary
days of winter were approaching, and even now at
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The northwest winds howled long and hollow over
the open hills and heathery wolds around Widecomb
Manor, and ever as their wild melancholy wail fell on
the ears of Theresa, as she sat by her now lonely
hearth, they awoke a thought of him, the playmate of
her happy childhood, from whom she had parted, not
as friends and playmates should part, and who was now
ploughing the far Atlantic, perhaps never to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow had fallen upon her brow; a gloom upon
her young and happy life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where was he who unconsciously, though not
perhaps unintentionally, had been the cause of the
cloud which had arisen, and whence that shadow, that
gloom? Where was Jasper St. Aubyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years had passed away since Durzil Bras-de-fer
set sail on the Virginia voyage, and from that day
no tidings had been heard of him in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, changes, dark melancholy changes,
had altered every thing at Widecomb. The two old
men, whom we last saw conversing cheerfully of
times long gone, and past joys unforgotten, had both
fallen asleep, to wake no more but to immortality.
Sir Miles St. Aubyn slept with his fathers in the bannered
and escutcheoned chapel adjoining the Hall,
wherein he had spent so many, and those the happiest,
of his days; while William Allan—he had preceded
his ancient friend, his old rival, but a few weeks on
their last journey—lay in the quiet village church-yard,
beneath the shade of the great lime-trees, among the
leaves of which he had loved to hear the hum of the
bees in his glad boyhood. The leaves waved as of
old, and twinkled in the sunshine, and the music of
the reveling bees was blithe as ever, but the eye that
had rejoiced at the calm scenery, the ear that had delighted
in the rural sound, was dim, and deaf forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happy—happy they. Whom no more cares should
reach, no more anxieties, forever—who now no more
had hopes to be blighted, joys to be tortured into sorrows,
and, worst of all, affections to breed the bitterest
griefs, and make calamity of so long life. Happy, indeed,
thrice happy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pleasant parlor, with large oriel windows
looking out upon the terrace of Widecomb Hall,
and over the beautiful green chase, studded with grand
old oaks, down to the deep ravine through which the
trout stream rushed, in which the present lord of that
fair demesne had so nearly perished at the opening of
my tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in that pleasant parlor, within the embrasure of
one of the great oriels, gazing out anxiously over the
lovely park, now darkening with the long shadows of
a sweet summer evening, there stood as beautiful a
being as ever gladdened the eye of friend, husband, or
lover, on his return from brief absence home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Theresa—Allan no longer, but St. Aubyn;
and with the higher rank which she had so deservedly
acquired, she had acquired, too, a higher and more
striking style of beauty. Her slender, girlish stature
had increased in height, and expanded in fullness,
roundness, symmetry, until the delicate and somewhat
fragile maiden had been matured into the perfect, full-blown
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face also was lovelier than of old; it had a
deeper, a more spiritual meaning. Love had informed
it, and experience. And the genius, dormant before,
and unsuspected save by the old fond father, sat enthroned
visibly on the pale, thoughtful brow, and looked
out gloriously from those serene, large eyes, filled as
they were to overflowing with a clear, lustrous, tranquil
light, which revealed to the most casual and
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
thoughtless observers, the purity, the truth, the whiteness
of the soul within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if you gazed on her more closely,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>You saw her at a nearer view</p>
<p class='line0'>A spirit, yet a woman too.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>You saw that how pure, how calm, how innocent so-ever,
she was not yet exempt from the hopes, the fears,
the passions, and the pains of womanhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman was more lovely than the girl, was
wiser, greater, perhaps better—alas! was she happier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been now nearly two years a wife, though
but within the last twelve months acknowledged and
installed as such in her husband’s house. It had been
a dark mystery, her love, the child of sorrow and concealment,
although she might thank her own true
heart, guided by principle, and lighted by a higher star
than any earthly passion, even the love of God, it had
not been the source of shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artfully, yet enthusiastically, had that bold, brilliant,
fascinating boy laid siege to her affections; and soon,
by dint of kindred tastes, and feelings, and pursuits, he
had succeeded in winning the whole perfect love of
that pure, overflowing soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She loved him with that fervor, that devotion, of
which women alone are perhaps capable, and of women,
only those who are gifted with that extreme sensibility,
that exquisite organization, which, rendering
them the most charming, the most fascinating, and the
most susceptible of their sex, too often renders them
the least happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, too, loved her—as well, perhaps, as one of
his character and temperament could love any thing,
except himself; he loved her <span class='it'>passionately</span>; he admired
her beauty, her grace, her delicacy, beyond
measure. He understood and appreciated her exquisite
taste, her brilliancy, her feminine and gentle
genius. He was not happy when he was absent from
her side; he could not endure the idea that she should
love, or even smile upon another, he coveted the possession
of a creature so beautiful, a soul so powerful,
and at the same time so loving. Above all, he was
proud to be loved by such a being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But beyond this he no more loved her, than the
child loves its toy. He held her only in his selfishness
of soul, even before his passion had</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Spent as yet its novel force,</p>
<p class='line0'>Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But he knew nothing, felt nothing, understood nothing
of her higher, better self; he saw nothing of her inner
light—guessed nothing of what a treasure he had won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have sacrificed nothing of his pleasures,
nothing of his prejudices, nothing of his pride, had such
a sacrifice been needed to make her the happiest of
women. While she would have laid down her life for
the mere delight of gaining him one moment’s joy—would
have sacrificed all that she had, or hoped to have,
save honor, faith and virtue. And to yield these he
never asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No! in the wildest dream of his reckless, unprincipled
imagination, he never fancied to himself the
possibility of tempting her to lawless love. In the very
boldest of his audacious flights, he never would have
dared to whisper one loose thought, one questionable
wish in the maiden’s ear. It had, perhaps, been
well he had done so—for on that instant, as the night-mists
melt away and leave the firmament pure and
transparent at the first glance of the great sun, the
cloud of passion which obscured her mental vision
would have been scattered and dispersed from her
clear intellect by the first word that had flashed on her
soul conviction of his baseness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whether the wish ever crossed his mind or not,
he never gave it tongue, nor did she even once suspect
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he had wooed her secretly—laying the blame
on his father’s pride, his father’s haughty and high ambition,
which he insisted would revolt at the bare idea
of his wedding with any lady, who could not point to
the quarterings of a long, noble line of ancestry; he had
prevailed on her, first to conceal their love, and at
length to consent to a secret marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long, indeed, ere he could bring her to agree
even to that clandestine step; nor, had her father lived
but a few weeks longer, would he have done so ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man died, however, suddenly, and at the
very moment when, though she knew it not, his life
was most necessary to his daughter’s welfare. He
was found dead in his bed, after one of those strange,
mysterious seizures, to which he had for many years
been subject, and during which he had appeared to be
endowed with something that approached nearly to a
knowledge of the future. Although, if such were, indeed,
the case, it was scarce less wonderful that on
the passing away of the dark fit, he seemed to have
forgotten all that he had seen and enunciated of what
should be thereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be this, however, as it may, he was found by his
unhappy child, dead, and already cold; but with his
limbs composed so naturally, and his fine benevolent
features wearing so calm and peaceful an expression,
that it was evident he had passed away from this
world of sin and sorrow, during his sleep, without a
pang or a struggle. Never did face of mortal sleeper
give surer token of a happy and glorious awakening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was gone, and she was alone, friendless,
helpless and unprotected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How friendless, how utterly destitute and helpless,
she knew not, nor had even suspected, until the last
poor relics of her only kinsman, save he who was a
thousand leagues aloof on the stormy ocean, had been
consigned to the earth, whence they had their birth
and being. Then, when his few papers were examined,
and his affairs scrutinized by his surviving, though now
fast declining friend, St. Aubyn, it appeared that he had
been supported only by a life-annuity, which died with
himself, and that he had left nothing but the cottage at
the fords, with the few acres of garden-ground, and the
slender personal property on the premises, to his
orphan child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was rendered probable by some memoranda and
brief notes, found among his papers, the greater part
of which were occupied by abstruse mathematical
problems, and yet wilder astrological calculations, that
he had looked forward to the union of his daughter
with the youth whom he had brought up as his own
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
son, and whose ample means, as well as his affection
for the lovely girl, left no doubt of his power and
willingness to become her protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he had observed, during his sojourn at the
cottage, led old Sir Miles, however, who had assumed
as an act of duty, no less than of pleasure, the character
of executor to his old friend, to suspect that the
simple-minded sage had in some sort reckoned without
his host; and that on one side, at least, there would be
found insuperable objections to his views for Theresa’s
future life. And in this opinion he was confirmed immediately
by a conversation which he had with the
poor girl, so soon as the first poignant agony of grief
had passed from her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this state of affairs, an asylum at the manor was
offered by the old cavalier, and accepted by the orphan
with equal frankness, but with a most unequal sense of
obligation—Sir Miles regarding his part in the transaction
as a thing of course, Theresa looking on it as an
action of the most exalted and extraordinary generosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, it had occurred already to the mind of the
old knight, so soon as he was satisfied within himself
that Theresa’s affections were not given to her wild
and dangerous cousin, that he would gladly see her
the wife of his own almost idolized boy. For, though
of no exalted or ennobled lineage, she was of gentle
blood, of an honorable parentage, which had been
long established in the county, and which, if fallen in
fortunes, had never lost caste, or been degraded, as he
would assuredly have deemed it, by participation in any
mechanical or mercantile pursuit. He had seen enough
of courts and courtiers to learn their hollowness, and
all the empty falsehood of their gorgeous show—he
had mingled enough in the great world to be convinced
that real happiness was not to be sought in the hurly-burly
of its perilous excitements, and incessant strife;
and that which would have rendered him the happiest,
would have been to see Jasper established, tranquilly,
and at his ease, with domestic bonds to ensure the permanency
of his happiness, before his own time should
come, as the Lord of Widecomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such were his views when he prevailed on
Theresa to let the House in the Woods be her home,
until at least such time as news could be received of
her cousin; who, certainly, whatever might be the
relative state of their affections, would never suffer her
to want a home or a protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had observed that Jasper was struck deeply by
the charms of the sweet girl; he knew, although he
had affected not to know it, that, under the pretence of
fishing or shooting excursions, he had been in the
almost daily habit of visiting her, since the accident
which had led to their acquaintance; and he was, above
all, well assured that the girl loved him with all the
deep, unfathomable devotion of which such hearts as
hers alone are capable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well pleased was he, therefore, to see the beautiful
being established in the halls of which he hoped to
see her, ere long, the mistress; and if he did not
declare his wishes openly to either on the subject, it
was that he was so well aware of his son’s headstrong
and willful temper, that he knew him fully capable of
refusing peremptorily the very thing which he most
desired, if proffered to him as a boon, much more
urged upon him as the desire of a third party—which
he was certain to regard as an interference with his
free will and self-regulation—while, at the same time
he feared to alarm Theresa’s delicacy, by anticipating
the progress of events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, with a heart overflowing with affection for
that wild, willful, passionate boy, released from the
only tie of obedience or restraint that could have bound
her, poor Theresa was delivered over, fettered as it
were, hand and foot, to the perilous influence of
Jasper’s artifices, and the scarce less dangerous suggestions
of her own affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was strange that, quick as she was and clever,
even beyond her sex’s wonted penetration, where
matters of the heart are concerned, Theresa never suspected
that the old cavalier had long perceived and
sanctioned their growing affection. But idolizing
Jasper as she did, and believing him all that was high
and generous and noble, seeing that all his external
errors tended to the side of rash, hasty impulse, never
to calculation or deceit, she saw every thing, as it
were, through his eyes, and was easily induced by him
to believe that all his father’s kindness and father-like
attention to her slightest wish, arose only from his love
for her lost parent, and compassion for her sad abandonment;
nay, further, he insisted that the least suspicion
of their mutual passion would lead to their instant
and eternal separation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was lamentable, that a being so bright, so excellent
as she, believing that such was the case, and
bound as she was by the closest obligations, the dearest
gratitude to that good old man, should have consented,
even for a moment, to deceive him, much more to frustrate
his wishes in a point so vital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was very young—she had been left without
the training of a mother’s watchful heart, without
the supervision of a mother’s earnest eye—she was
endowed marvelously with those extreme sensibilities
which are invariably a part of that high nervous organization,
ever connected with poetical genius; she
loved Jasper with a devotedness, a singleness, and at
the same time a consuming heat of passion, which
scarcely could be believed to exist in one so calm, so
self-possessed, and so innocently-minded—and, above
all, she had none else in the wide world on whom to
fix her affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the boy profited by this; and with the sharpness
of an intellect, which, if far inferior to hers in depth
and real greatness, was as far superior to it in worldly
selfishness and instinctive shrewdness, played upon
her nervous temperament, till he could make each
chord of her secret soul thrill to his touch, as if they
had been the keys of a stringed instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hearts of the young who love, must ever, must
naturally resent all interference of the aged, who
would moderate or oppose their love, as cold, intrusive
tyranny; and thus, with plausible and artful sophistry,
abetted by the softness of her treacherous heart, too
willing to be deceived, he first led her to regard his
father as opposed to the wishes of that true love, which,
for all the great poet knew or had heard, “never did
run smooth,” and thence to resent that opposition as
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
unkind, unjust, tyrannical; and thence—alas! for
Theresa!—to deceive the good old man, her best
friend on earth—ay, to deceive herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not mine to palliate, much less to justify her conduct.
I have but to relate a too true tale; and in relating
it, to show, in so far as I can, the mental operations,
the self-deceptions, and the workings of passion—from
which not even the best and purest of mankind are
exempt—by which an innocent and wonderfully constituted
creature was betrayed into one fatal error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was persuaded—words can tell no more!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a grievous fault, and grievously <span class='it'>Theresa</span>
answered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When ill things are devised, and to be done, ill
agents are soon found, especially by the young, the
wealthy, and the powerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The declining health of Sir Miles St. Aubyn was no
secret in the neighborhood—the near approach of his
death was already a matter of speculation; and already
men almost looked on Jasper as the Lord, <span class='it'>in esse</span>, of
the estates of Widecomb Manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old white-headed vicar had a son, poor like
himself, and unaspiring—like himself, in holy orders;
and for him, when his own humble career should be
ended, he hoped the reversion of the vicarage, which
was in the gift of the proprietor of Widecomb. The
old man had known Jasper from his boyhood, had
loved Theresa, whom he had, indeed, baptized, from
her cradle. He was very old and infirm, and some believed
that his intellect was failing. Between his
affection for the parties, and his interest in his son’s
welfare, it was easy to frame a plausible tale, which
should work him to Jasper’s will; and with even less
difficulty than the boy looked for, he was prevailed
upon to unite them secretly, and at the dead of night,
in the parish church at the small village by the fords.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sexton of the parish church was a low knave,
with no thought beyond his own interest, no wish but
for the accumulation of gain. A gamekeeper, devoted
to the young master’s worst desires, a fellow who had
long ministered to his most evil habits, and had in no
small degree assisted to render him what he was, only
too willingly consented to aid in an affair which he
saw clearly would put the young heir in his power
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was selected as one of the witnesses—for without
witnesses, the good but weak old vicar would not perform
the ceremony; and he promised to bring a second,
in the person of his aged and doting mother, the respectability
of whose appearance should do away with
any scruples of Theresa’s, while her infirmity should
render her a safe depository of the most dangerous
secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And why all this mystery—this tortuous and base
deviation from the path of right—this unnecessary
concealment, and unmeaning deceit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherefore, if the boy were, indeed, what he has
been described, and no more, impulsive, willful, rash,
headlong, irresistible in his impulses—if not a base
traitor, full of dark plots, deep-laid beforehand—wherefore,
if he did love the girl, with all the love of which
his character was capable, if he had not predetermined
to desert her—wherefore did he not wed her openly
in the light of day, amid crowds of glad friends, and
rejoicing dependents? Why did he not gladden the heart
of his aged father, and lead her to the home of his
ancestors a happy and honored bride, without that one
blot on her conscience, without that one shadow of
deceit, which marred the perfect truthfulness of her
character, and in after days weighed on her mind
heavily?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus always, the last mentioned among the holy
Apostles, and with the brand of shame attached to his
name, is Judas Iscariot, the traitor, brought before us.
And inasmuch as from the lives of them, who in all
circumstances continued faithful to their Lord, lessons
of the highest benefit may be drawn by the teachable
mind, I am constrained to think there comes to us a
lesson and a warning we may not lightly heed, from
him who “by transgression fell.” He, too, when the
Voice was heard crying in the wilderness gave willing
heed; he, too, amid the eager crowd was seen listening
anxiously to the inspired word of John the Baptist;
he, too, when the meek Saviour came, attended
on His preaching, and his heart was stirred by the
words of entreaty and condemnation that he heard.
He, too, would fain believe, and be forgiven, and be
numbered among the disciples of the new king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, as one of the twelve Apostles, he was
chosen, and in a peculiar manner recognized by the
Saviour as one of his own household, Judas rejoiced—for
he doubtless conceived that if Christ’s kingdom
was to be of an earthly nature, it was certainly a great
advancement, and a high honor, to be chosen publicly
as one of His chief ministers. How then must he
have listened to the words of Jesus, when, after he
had selected the Twelve, he charged them with their
duty, and told them all that they must bear and suffer
for His sake. “In the world ye shall have tribulation
and sorrow—but, be of good cheer, I have overcome
the world.” One cannot but think that the latter part
of this declaration must have fallen with little weight
on the disappointed heart of Judas. The Saviour had
consecrated them to their holy work—to the lives of
persecution, and sorrow, and pain, which He knew
awaited them—he was calling down the power of his
spirit to rest and abide with each of them, the power
which should enable them to release guilty humanity
from its load of sin, wherever it should be felt in its
oppressiveness—and while in humility the eyes of
some of those disciples were fixed upon the ground,
unto his majestic countenance others were raised,
catching from his fervid devotion the spark of heavenly
fire that was to make them indeed beacon lights on the
mountain of Truth! By the words he uttered, he
bade them remember the difficulties which would beset
them—fully pointing out to them the thorny path
which they must tread. Not with the conviction that
a life of ease was before them went they forth. They
had enlisted as soldiers in His service, it was therefore
meet that they should know the dangers of the
hostile country through which they were to pass.
“Behold I send you forth as sheep amidst wolves!”
Danger, privation, and perchance a horrible death
were the foes they were to meet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, those dangers all revealed, He did not leave
them struck down, as it were, by the heavy weight of
the cross they had chosen to bear—kind words, encouraging
promises, assurances of his fatherly protection
and guidance fell from his lips, and comforted
and cheered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one heart on which the words of the
Saviour fell with chilling force—in his hearing, was
now forever decided the question as to the nature of
Christ’s kingdom and service. When Judas heard
that calm, deep voice telling of the power of the
enemy into whose hands they were voluntarily placing
themselves—when he became convinced of the danger
and wo which would encircle them on every side—that
the prison might prove their place of abode—that
the scourge and instruments of torture would be the
welcoming extended to them in the world—that contumely,
shame and reproach, and despiteful treatment
would inevitably meet them in all their wanderings,
he shrunk back—when he listened to the promises
Jesus made to them of rest in heaven, of the continued
care of God, which nevertheless might not preserve
them from a death of torture and ignominy—when he
reflected that the rewards promised were none of them
of a temporal nature, and were to be made good only
in the dim future, in another existence that was called
eternal, he shrunk from the prospect of so much present
misery, to be endured for a reward so vague—he
forgot the weight of glory that was to be revealed, or,
if he remembered it at all, the future of bliss was so
far distant, and the promises so obscure, that they fell
like dust in the balance of that scale where wo, vexation
and privations innumerable were to be weighed.
Better, ah far better, he thought, that former life of
labor and obscurity he had led, than a life of such publicity
and danger as he was now to lead. None ever
molested him <span class='it'>then</span>, quietly and peacefully he had lived
till that hour when he lent too willing an ear to the
compassionate words of Him who spoke, not as man,
but as God and Saviour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet despite this irresoluteness, when the young
man thought of his companions who were setting forth
so zealously on the path at whose very threshold he
faltered, he was almost constrained to rush boldly onward
with them. His pride shrunk from the thought
of proving so soon recreant to the cause which he had
espoused so gladly and earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That first moment when he wavered in his zeal—when
his determination faltered—we may count as
the moment of his downfall, of his fearful ruin—that
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
moment when the first bewildering thought rushed
into his brain, what shall I gain by this life of self-denial?—that
moment when the chilling conviction of
the folly of his enthusiasm in the service of Christ
crept over him—that moment of unguarded temptation
when Satan obtained a hearing, that was his trial-time—then
he was found wanting—<span class='it'>then he fell</span>—then was
he lost to the cause he had vowed to support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet in that moment of hesitation it is not to be
supposed that Judas had the courage, or even the wish,
forever to reject and disown his master, Jesus. We
cannot believe that he had crept into the camp of Salvation
under false colors, merely to spy out its secrets,
its most vulnerable points, that so he might deliver the
great chief of the army into the hands of his enemy.
Not so. It was impossible for the man to harden in
unbelief; for such convincing proof of the might and
divinity of Jesus had been given him, as it was not
possible for him to reject. And as he pondered on the
gentle and touching loving kindness that Master had
shown toward him and his apostolic brethren, it may
be that the desire to aid and to serve him became for
the time stronger even than his natural cowardice and
selfishness. And this may be the reason why he resolved
for a little time, at least, to be considered by the
people as one of the followers of Jesus. And in making
this decision there may possibly have revived in
the man’s heart a little of that fervor of spirit which
he had once felt for the sacred cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was, that again his face turns toward the upward
path, and for a season he will continue therein.
Thus goes he forth on his mission, entertaining in his
heart two guests, whose hopes and aspirations, whose
every end and aim are totally at variance. Love of
the world, of his former life of careless sin, and of
money, that root of all evil, was there; and there also
was a standard bearer from the camp of Heaven, who
came upholding a banner which, at the will of the entertainer,
he would have gladly unfurled upon the
highest battlement of the castle of his soul—against
which the powers of sin and darkness were knocking,
and demanding entrance, with voices which reverberated
through every secret corner of the tenement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That banner once unfurled, the importunate foe
would flee in haste—oh, why was the word not spoken—the
word which would so speedily have scattered
those convulsing legions? Because—ponder upon it,
thou who art halting between two opinions—because
the master of that castle faltered at his post through
fear and indecision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has gone forth now on the path of discipleship,
and his works of miraculous power proclaim him. At
his call and command the gates of oblivion are opened,
and the dead come back to life—the sick, laid on their
couches of pain and agony, arise and walk at his word;
and the gospel of mercy and salvation sounds with
marvelous success when its blessings are proclaimed
by his eloquent tongue to the weary, and the poor, and
the heavy-laden. The evil spirits suffered to torment
them who would fain tread in the right path are cast
forth, and then the sorrowing repentant goeth on his
way rejoicing! But, as he works all this good for
others, his own mind is tormented by the conflicting
voices which are calling to him. He stills the tempests
in the minds of the distressed, and those burdened
with cruel doubts, but in his own breast there is a
storm raging continually, which he <span class='it'>cannot</span> command
to silence. He holds up to the parched and dying
creatures surrounding him a cup, while he proclaims,
“Ho ye that thirst! buy wine, buy milk, without
money and without price!” “Drink, and ye shall not
thirst again!” while he himself is dying of thirst—and
ever as he raises to his own lips the cup which contains
the healing for the nations, his spirit shrinks back
from the draught—it will not drink—it is gall and
wormwood to him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifts his voice, and conviction and peace fall upon
them who listen to him. Repentance is hurled to the
sinful heart with the words, “His yoke is easy, and
His burden light!” while himself is drooping and
fainting under the weight of deceit which is upon him.
Wherever he goes he proclaims “Peace!” to the
children of men—and peace visits all who will hearken
to him. But in his own breast—ah, <span class='it'>there</span> is warfare
and strife, the accusings of conscience, the warnings
of wrath to come! In the chambers of sickness, where
the dying were restored to health; by the wayside,
where the foully diseased were cleansed—before the
opened tomb, whence at his call the dead came clothed
once again with the garment of life, amid the multitudes
who listened with deepest interest to his most
forcible words, alone, in the solitude of his own heart,
or when in holy communion of thought with the faithful
brethren, alike at all times, and in all places, heard
he the still small voice of his accusing spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outward form of grace was his, but the purification
had not penetrated into the recesses of his heart!
The agonizing knowledge that at each onward step he
was plunging deeper and deeper into the sin which
could not be forgiven—the continual remembrance
that he was dispensing to others the mercy of that God
who would forget to be gracious to him, may be easily
conjectured; but may Heaven spare us all from such
agony of conflicting thoughts and hopes as must have
been the daily and nightly companion of Judas Iscariot,
long before he came out from the disciples’ ranks to
betray his lord into the hands of sinners!</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the magnificent chambers of the High Priest,
adorned with so much costliness and luxury, Caiaphas
sat in state. Ushered in by menials, a young man
enters timidly to the presence of the haughty potentate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dignity of mien which once distinguished the
ambassador of the Lord, which would not bend to the
splendor of court or king, is no longer to be seen in
Judas. The meanness of servility speaks in every
motion, every word of the man—his self-respect is
gone, and with it all the confidence of manhood. But
if the craftiness of the stranger’s appearance struck
most unfavorably on the High Priest, how much more
must he have been startled and amazed, as Judas unfolded
the reason of his appearance there; and it was
not till his mission was fully revealed that Caiaphas
recognized in the craven supplicant one of those far-famed
Apostles, with whose names he was already
familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
The proud man must have shrunk back in horror
from the revolting proposal of Judas—for, though it
placed within his reach the accomplishment of one of
the highest wishes of his life, (the deliverance of Christ
into his hands,) yet the means by which he was offered
the capture were opposed to all the principles of his
creed of manly honor. Could he in all his high mightiness
stoop to receive the prisoner at the hands of one
who had been his friend—his companion and ministering
servant? No—he must certainly at the first have
turned away contemptuously from the detail of such
consummate villainy; it must surely have been more
than even he could countenance—for though not wont
to cavil at the means employed, when any wished for
end was to be gained, yet Caiaphas <span class='it'>must</span> have wondered,
as the question burst from the covetous impatient
heart of Judas, “What will ye give me, and I
will deliver him unto you?” But as the High Priest
pondered on that question, gradually his spirit ceased
its noble revolting, he began to lose sight of the contemptible,
horrible treachery of the man on his knees
before his throne, and he felt something like rejoicing
in the thought, that the object he had so longed to accomplish,
was within his reach at last. Therefore it
was not long ere he turned with a more readily listening
ear, and began to <span class='it'>bargain</span> with the Apostle!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the agreement was made—the covenant
formed—the price of the Saviour’s life was set, and the
thirty pieces of silver were paid into the hands of
Judas! And then the traitor arose, and went from the
presence-chamber of Caiaphas, but faintness was within
his dastard heart, and the flush of shame upon his forehead,
and with downcast eyes, and hasty step he went,
for in his hands he bore the proofs of his condemning
guilt and sordid meanness; knowing also that even the
enemies of Christ, gladly as they would receive Him
into their power, had shrunk from taking the prisoner
from an apostle’s hands. But, the contract was made,
the wages of sin were in his hands; for Judas there
was no going back; onward—onward—onward he was
impelled by the unchained fiend within him, to work
out his own eternal ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He must know rest neither day nor night—constantly
he must be on the alert, that Jesus should not
altogether escape him—and when the favorable moment
arrived, he was to deliver Him up to the
rulers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that price of the innocent blood in his
hands he dared still to labor and associate with the
holy Apostles, dared to express submission and reverence
for the God who read his every inmost thought.
It seems a thing almost incredible—for the paltry sum
of money he had dared appoint himself the judge to
deliver the prisoner into the executioner’s hands!
Already he had been guilty of taking money from the
common purse of the disciples, which was entrusted to
him, in order that he might gratify his selfish desires—and
this guilt was known to Jesus, but the compassionate
Saviour had refrained from making it known;
it would have brought down dishonor on the holy
cause which Judas at the best served so unfaithfully,
and would have heaped on the sinful man’s own head
shame and condemnation, had the transaction been
made known publicly—thus he was still suffered to
retain his post of trust and honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were we not daily beholding crimes, only less heinous
than those of Judas, it would be difficult indeed for
us to conceive his guilt! We could not believe it
possibly within the range of human capability to sin,
that he would sacrifice even his God for money! The
Saviour’s blood—it was indeed a high price to pay for
thirty pieces of silver! But, though his crime was
such as has placed the name of Judas the very first on
the long, long list of human guilt—though, from the
very nature, and necessity of things, there never can
be another soul stained with sin so deep and dreadful,
though now, when as a completed whole we survey
our blessed Saviour’s life on earth, we stand aghast as
we think on his betrayer, yet, my reader, who among
us shall dare to say that had we lived in those days
we surely would have been guiltless of the blood of
that just man? There is nothing easier than to accuse
our “first parents,” Adam and Eve, of an unaccountable
transgression—it is very easy to <span class='it'>say</span> that nothing
could ever have tempted <span class='it'>us</span> to the commission of a
crime so great—I would assuredly be the last to <span class='it'>dare</span>
uphold Judas in his deadly sin, or to endeavor to
cleanse from his name the terrible blackness of the
crime attached to it—it was monstrous guilt of which
he through all the ages has stood convicted, but I repeat,
by no means was it unaccountable!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Think of our world, and of human nature as it is
now, after so many centuries have passed, and the
light of knowledge has spread far and wide. Consider
what the covetousness, the folly, the ambition of the
heart work among us now; behold even at this hour,
what multitudes are there among us who are scoffers,
and deniers, and mockers of the Lord who bought
them! Ah, were it a veritable truth which the Jews
believe and assert, that the Messiah has not yet come,
even now would not be found wanting the vengeful
unbelievers, the betrayer, the judge, the proud religion,
the cross, and the thorny crown, and earth and
heaven would be rent again with that cry which a
false-hearted people wrung from Him who died upon
the cross!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feast of the Passover was at hand, and the little
band of apostles which had been widely dispersed, fulfilling
every where they went their onerous duties,
met together once more to celebrate the feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at eventide the holy men assembled in the
“upper room” of a house to which Jesus had directed
them, wherein they had made ready for the ceremonial
celebration. But it was a new feast, to partake of
which the Saviour had called them together. The forms
of the ancient days were being fast set aside; there was
no more need that the lamb should be slain in commemoration
of the mercy of God in a time when his
people were in most dire necessity—soon was a Lamb
to be sacrificed whose efficacious blood was to save,
and cleanse from sin all who would have faith in God
and his crucified Son. And it was meet that <span class='it'>that</span>
night, when the feast of the Passover was wont to be
celebrated, should be chosen for the superseding of a
dead form by a more living faith. The consecrated
bread and wine, the emblems of His sacred body and
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
blood, these were the symbols to be used—there was
not any longer need for the shedding of the blood of
beasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twelve were all together. They had come rejoicing
that they might meet again with their Master
in safety and peace, that they might once more listen
to His words and counsel whom they loved so well.
In their short time of separation they had met all of
them with wonderful success, and the scornful, harsh
rebukes they had oftentimes been forced to listen to,
they had patiently, ay, gladly endured, for it was all
for Him, and they could not but rejoice that they were
counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. But
reproach, and contumely, and condemnation of the
world, was not all that they had met; they had looked
on eyes their words had caused to brighten with joy—they
had heard voices, sad and desponding, raised in
hymns of thanksgiving and rejoicing—they had seen
many hopeful manifestations of repentance, had pointed
out to many the straight path and the narrow way leading
to eternal life. Well might they come as faithful
stewards with gladness and haste at the call of their
Lord!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did I say <span class='it'>all</span> came with rejoicing to look upon their
Master’s face again? nay, verily, <span class='it'>not all</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One in their midst whose words had flown far over
the land, who had besought sinners most effectually to
repent, who had given to many a most blessed hope,
came among them to partake of the feast of the Passover,
to offer to his brethren the hand of fellowship,
wherein he had so recently clapped with greedy joy
the infamous price of the Redeemer’s blood!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>He</span> came with a troubled mind, feeling that he had
no right to commune with the more faithful eleven,
and dreading to meet the glance of the Searcher of
Hearts. He knew full well, that though his brethren
and fellow-laborers beheld his successful preaching
with gladness, that they could see no further—they
could do no more than judge him by his outward acts,
which had, as far as their knowledge went, been always
blameless—but he also knew that He who had
bidden them to the supper gazed with more than human
power of vision into his evil heart, that He saw
and beheld the vile thing which he had done; full well
the fearful sinner knew that the flimsy veil he had
been able to fling over his guilt, was far from being
efficient to screen him from the scrutinizing gaze of his
Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, how like the knell of condemnation must those
mournful words have fallen on the ear of Judas:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verily I say unto you that one of <span class='it'>you</span> shall betray
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the sudden death of every hope of concealment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fear and wonder filled the minds of the faithful
eleven. One of <span class='it'>them</span> betray their beloved Master? It
was a thought inconceivable to them. With astonished
looks they turned from one to another, and with full
confidence in the integrity of their hearts they asked,
“Lord, is it I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solemnly upon the stillness broke that answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He that dippeth his hand into the dish with me, the
same shall betray me, and wo unto that man by whom
the Son of Man is betrayed, it had been good for that
man had he never been born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When these fearful words of warning were pronounced,
and every voice was hushed, and every
heart was awe-struck, again was heard the trembling
voice of Judas the guilty, echoing faintly, and as though
irresistibly <span class='it'>compelled</span> to utter the words, “Master, is
it <span class='it'>I</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sad eyes of the eleven were fixed upon their
brother and their Lord, and oh what a thrill of horror
must have run through every heart as the answer
“<span class='it'>Thou hast said</span>,” was whispered in a tone of sorrowful
reproach by the Saviour, who knew that he
was already betrayed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Judas saw the reproachful expression that
every face wore, and was thus assured that his
treachery was known, he felt his place was no longer
amid the faithful followers and servants of Jesus—he
knew well enough the just horror with which the holy
men surrounding him would look upon his ingratitude
and soul-destroying guilt. He had still sense enough
left to feel that he should no longer remain among
those who had such cause to deeply deplore the desecration
he had done the service of Christ; and, too,
his inclination for, and pleasure in that service, and his
desire to remain in that holy company was gone. He
had chosen another master, even the Evil One—he
must fight under another banner, even that of the
Blackness of Darkness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Publicly he had parted with his heavenly portion for
a mere handful of silver, and now what part or lot had
he in the work, to do which a clean heart and a right
spirit were so pre-eminently required? Self-forgetfulness,
constancy, devotion, truth, he lacked all these!
how then could <span class='it'>he</span> further the cause of the Redeemer?
Judas must have gone from that chamber of mournful
feasting feeling himself to be a doomed man, bearing
upon himself the full weight of the heavy curse of
God!</p>

<p class='pindent'>An impassable barrier, an unfathomable gulf lay now
between him and the works of holiness—a separating
wall built even by his own willing hands up to the
portal of heaven, shut him forever from the hope of
mercy or the possibility of repentance!</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='pindent'>It is night. Over the Garden of Gethsemane is
spread the shadow of a dark cloud. The moon’s light
is obscured; or, where at intervals it appears between
the broken clouds, its dim rays render the sadness and
silence of the place only more mournful still. To the
quietness and retirement of that garden, One has come
whose soul is filled with sorrow even unto death! He
has spoken kindly words of love to his disciples, he has
bidden them tarry in the garden to watch with Him;
but though Jesus would fain have them nigh, his agony
and suffering were too great for any but the Father to
witness, therefore he went apart from them, and falling
on his face, in the depth of anguish he prayed, “Oh!
my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me—nevertheless
not as I will, but as Thou wilt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bending submissively to the will of that Father in all
things, he could drink even the bitterness of that cup
wherein was garnered a whole world’s sin. Three
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
times was the agonized prayer repeated, and still the
aid from heaven was not sent, nor the bitter cup removed!
Oh, reader, by that night of unexampled
agony, by the blood-drops which burst from <span class='it'>our</span> Saviour
in the extremity of His anguish, bedewing the
ground of Gethsemane—by the remembrance of the
cross-planted Calvary—by the bitterness of that draught
the dregs of which were not spared, how are we taught,
and warned, and implored to consider well the value
of that sacrifice which He has made <span class='it'>for us</span>! Can’st
thou think on that night of unexampled agony and
longer refrain from flinging thyself wholly, with no reserve,
at the foot of the blood-stained cross? Oh never
suffer the remembrance of that night of passion to fade
from thy mind or from thy heart—let it cling to thee
continually, inciting to patience, and courage, and faith,
till thou hast learned by them to enter the path from
which His death has taken the sorrow, to which His
agony has lent the glory! Thus shall the cross-crowned
Calvary prove to thee a sure reliable ray that
shall guide thee to heaven; thus shall the blood-dew
shed in Gethsemane, spread a reviving freshness over
the dying tree of Faith, which perchance is drooping
even at this moment in thy heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Saviour’s last prayer is breathed forth when the
sound as of a multitude breaks on his ear—full well
He knoweth who it is that is now hastening on and
entering the Garden sanctified by His presence to take
Him captive. Foremost among the ruthless intruders
comes one whose treacherously smiling face tells of
guilt, and ill-concealed shame, and remorse. He treads
through the else silent garden, where the night blooming
flowers are just opening, shedding their rich perfumes
abroad; but Judas heeds not the beauty and
tranquillity of that place—carelessly his feet trample
upon the fair blossoms unfolding, which though crushed
still rise again as the weight is removed, and their perfumes
ascend to heaven on the evening air, a living
witness against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The multitude come armed as if to the fray—swords
and staves are in their hands, curses and execrations
escape their lips, and thoughts of fiery vengeance and
hatred fill their minds. He whom they seek stands
awaiting them. He makes no effort to escape, though
had He willed it, His Father had instantly sent legions
of angels to deliver him. No—his hour was come!
the hour for which He left the brightness of the heavenly
kingdom—the hour for which he had put on
mortality had arrived—he would not delay it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The torches which the arch-traitor and his companions
bore fell on the little group of men they sought—the
defiant Apostles, and the calm and unmoved son
of Mary. The multitude faltered in their purpose as
they looked upon these men—the bold, brave-hearted
Peter, the loving John, the humble, faithful, affectionate
James, and the man Christ Jesus whom they came
to make captive. Sorrow, such as never beamed from
the eyes of a mortal being, and the consciousness of a
power that was able to scatter at once, as chaff, those
who had come out to make Him captive, spoke from
His countenance distinctly and audibly to their sin-hardened
minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Judas—Judas hesitated not. When he saw the
Man he was to betray standing before him, making no
effort to escape, he dropped the torch which had
lighted him on his awful mission, and flinging his arms
around the Divinity, <span class='it'>he kissed Him</span>! and as he embraced
with the lips the God he had offered to betray,
Judas cried aloud in a tone of affectionate and joyful
recognition, “Master! Master!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aside from the horrible, daring guilt of Judas, there
is something humiliating and revolting in the thought
of the traitor’s assuming friendliness, and love even, as
the guise under which to make successful his nefarious
scheme. A kiss, the most fond, familiar greeting;
by that Christ was made known to those who came to
take Him by violence, as though He were a thief, or a
common offender, or breaker of the laws of the land!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the remainder of that night the Scriptures tell us
naught of the betrayer. We do not hear of his appearing
before Caiaphas as a witness against his Lord—all
his part in that most awful transaction seems to have
been fulfilled—the accusation and condemnation were
for others to make. It is no pleasant task to picture to
the fancy the manner in which the remaining hours of
Judas’ life must have passed. The torturing of conscience—the
deadly fear—the sting and constant consciousness
of guilt which <span class='it'>must</span> have tormented him, is
what the mind shrinks from contemplating, but to
which it returns, as if of necessity, again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deed was accomplished, there remained nothing
further for him to do, and so he went out from the sacred
garden by himself, that he might be alone, and
count over in security and feast his eyes on the fruits
of his guilt. Ah, that shining treasure! those thirty
pieces of silver! At the moment when for the first
time a full conviction of the iniquity of his deed swept
over his thought, and could be kept back no longer by
his will, then it was, if ever, that he <span class='it'>needed</span> to
strengthen his covetous heart; and how better could
he accomplish that than by keeping in constant sight
the much loved riches he had gained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while he counted over the glittering heap, how
very strange! he did not rejoice in it as he had thought to!
Possession had robbed anticipation of all allurements
and pleasure, and while alone, watched only by the
eye of his God he counted over the riches, constantly
haunted him those words Jesus spoke on the night of
the feast of the Passover, “it were better for that man
had he never been born!” Judas already was accursed—already
was given over to the power of the tormentors;
already his terrified mind was conjuring up the
death and sufferings of the Saviour he had betrayed,
and that coveted, cherished silver was as a stone
hanging about his neck, dragging him down, down to
the depths of the sea of perdition!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the first rays of daylight streamed over Jerusalem,
might have been seen, I fancy, the form of Judas
Iscariot wandering through the city, seeking to escape
from his condemning thoughts; oh, the accusations, so
fraught with everlasting wo, his heart must have whispered
to him, when the sunlight fell upon him and the
fresh breeze of morning fanned his brow!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the palace where the judges still slept, the
wretched man paced to and fro, bearing with him the
thrice accursed silver which burned his bosom—burned
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
his soul. As yet there were few signs of life in the
silent streets. Only the humblest laborers had come
forth to begin with the earliest light their day of toil.
Judas gazed on them as they went calmly and cheerfully
about their accustomed tasks, oh, how wistfully!
Could <span class='it'>he</span> only once more know that lightness of heart
which innocence alone confers! Could <span class='it'>he</span> but look
on the glad light of the sun, and see there no accusing
form which now incessantly uprose before his imagination!
Could he but listen to the voice of Nature,
without feeling that for him she sung only a far-resounding
chorus of condemnation! Could he only go
forth to his peaceful labor, and forget that fearful
looking for of judgment which now alone awaited
him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As by degrees the streets filled with men, and women,
and little children, how suspiciously and consciously
his eyes glanced at all who passed by him, the
greetings of the companions of former days were unreturned,
or misunderstood, for Judas wondered how
that <span class='it'>any</span> should speak to <span class='it'>him</span>! And when the Pharisee
went by, folding his robes closely about him, lest
they might come in contact with the garments of the
poor publican, when with a supercilious look which
said so plainly, “Stand back, for I am holier than
thou!” he felt the justice of the unspoken rebuke
though it did come from sinful humanity. And when
troops of gay and innocent children passed on, their
voices of mirth and gladness filling the air which was
ere long to echo with the dying Saviour’s cry and the
mocking shouts of unbelieving Jews, he crept more
closely to the wall, fearing lest his sin penetrated garments
might by a touch convey contamination!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the palace-gates were opened, and breathlessly
Judas rushed within, and entered unbidden, unannounced
and alone the presence chamber of Caiaphas,
where he had stood so recently to bargain for the blood
of Jesus Christ!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the chief priest, and the scribes and rulers
had gathered together to confer respecting the fate of
their prisoner. How astonished must they have looked
upon the haggard, guilt-stricken man who came so suddenly
before them! No wonder if they started in fear
as they saw the despairing look of his blood-shot eyes,
for the glare of a maniac was in them. With outspread
hands he held the dear-bought money toward
them, while the wailing of a spirit doomed forever to
despair broke forth in the words, “I have sinned! I
have betrayed the innocent blood!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fearful mockery and derision came back the answer,
“<span class='it'>What is that to us! See thou to that!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vainly did he look for sympathy there! Hardened,
selfish, sinful, they could not even feel for him who
had been all too late aroused by the tortures of remorse
to a sense of his most awful guilt. It was a vain thing
to appeal to them to receive again the silver and let the
precious prisoner go free!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, what marvel that the wretched man should
have shrunk from an existence which he was well
assured would never be blessed by one hour free from
the maddening tortures of his conscience? What
wonder that he hastened from the presence of the
fiendish Caiaphas to die before the sentence of condemnation
had been passed on the Master whom his
treachery had given to the cross? What wonder,
reader, that the wretched man perished by his own
hands? and can the wildest hoper believe that his
was not an eternal death?</p>

<p class='line0'>One night, when skies were bright and calm,</p>
<p class='line0'>I left my home in Amsterdam;</p>
<p class='line0'>I cast my schuyt from moorings loose</p>
<p class='line0'>And steered across to Wilhelm Sluis:</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the North Canal I sailed;</p>
<p class='line0'>The wind was fair and never failed.</p>
<p class='line0'>Quoth I: “My prow shall kiss no sand</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Before an hour I saw the town,</p>
<p class='line0'>And soon the tapering mast was down;</p>
<p class='line0'>But ere I left my graceful schuyt</p>
<p class='line0'>I heard the music of a flute;</p>
<p class='line0'>And songs of love and shouts of joy</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the wind came floating by.</p>
<p class='line0'>Quoth I: “They seem a happy band</p>
<p class='line0'>That dwell in Broek-in-Waterland.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I walked upon a winding street</p>
<p class='line0'>That seemed too clean for mortal feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ere long a stranger met my gaze—</p>
<p class='line0'>What joy!—one loved in boyish days!</p>
<p class='line0'>Quoth he: “We revel here to-night,</p>
<p class='line0'>That all may share in my delight,</p>
<p class='line0'>For soon I’ll claim the fairest hand</p>
<p class='line0'>In happy Broek-in-Waterland.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>As thus he spoke, we walked along,</p>
<p class='line0'>And soon were mingled in the throng;</p>
<p class='line0'>He vowed, in all a lover’s pride,</p>
<p class='line0'>That I should see his chosen bride,</p>

<p class='line0'>The richest, claims the fairest hand</p>
<p class='line0'>In happy Broek-in-Waterland!”</p>

<p class='line0'>A hopeless anguish seized my heart!</p>
<p class='line0'>It once had been my lot to save</p>
<p class='line0'>A maiden from the Zuyder’s wave;</p>

<p class='line0'>And never thought to see her more;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor did I, till I saw her stand</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span></p>
<p class='line0'>But why such grief? for what to me</p>
<p class='line0'>This maiden saved from Zuyder Zee?</p>
<p class='line0'>She knew me not before that day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Scarce saw me ere I turned away.</p>
<p class='line0'>I heard her voice, I saw her face,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet asked nor name nor dwelling place.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then why this grief to see her stand</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Love’s deeds are wild—his power divine!</p>
<p class='line0'>The maiden’s eye had glanced to mine!</p>
<p class='line0'>I heard her speak of thanks to me,</p>
<p class='line0'>My heart was moved and yet was free;</p>
<p class='line0'>But parting told, and told too late,</p>
<p class='line0'>That love had mingled with my fate;</p>
<p class='line0'>And now another claimed her hand</p>
<p class='line0'>And heart, in Broek-in-Waterland!</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Grown sick at heart, I turned to go,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lest men might see and mock my wo;</p>

<p class='line0'>I looked, the sky, of late so blue,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was hung in clouds of darkest hue;</p>
<p class='line0'>An ocean-storm had reached our strand,</p>

<p class='line0'>Looked quickly round, with dauntless brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>And cried: “Come death or freedom now!”</p>
<p class='line0'>Strange words were these! but marked by none,</p>
<p class='line0'>For even the lover now had flown,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I, alone, for her had planned</p>
<p class='line0'>Escape from Broek-in-Waterland.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Thus far, it seemed she knew me not;</p>
<p class='line0'>I turned to draw her from the spot;</p>
<p class='line0'>But long before I reached her side,</p>
<p class='line0'>She saw—she knew me! and she cried:</p>
<p class='line0'>“The guardian of my life restored!</p>
<p class='line0'>My own, though seeming lost! adored!</p>
<p class='line0'>With thee I dare all storms withstand,</p>
<p class='line0'>Come! fly from Broek-in-Waterland!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Around my neck her arms were prest,</p>
<p class='line0'>She laid her cheek upon my breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then, yielding, swooned, as if no harm</p>
<p class='line0'>Could pass the shelter of my arm!</p>
<p class='line0'>An age of thought swept through my brain,</p>
<p class='line0'>And joy that rose to fearful pain:</p>
<p class='line0'>“All mad!” I shrieked, “some demon’s wand</p>
<p class='line0'>Is held o’er Broek-in-Waterland!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>’Twas but a moment! then I knew</p>
<p class='line0'>A chance with every moment flew;</p>
<p class='line0'>For as I bear her through the street</p>
<p class='line0'>The waves come dashing round my feet.</p>
<p class='line0'>My schuyt floats on the deepening tide;</p>
<p class='line0'>By struggling long I reach her side.</p>
<p class='line0'>With oar and sail at my command,</p>
<p class='line0'>We’re saved from Broek-in-Waterland!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>An hour has past—in Wester Dock</p>
<p class='line0'>The maid recovers from the shock;</p>
<p class='line0'>But, danger past, deep blushes rise,</p>
<p class='line0'>Hot tears of shame start from her eyes;</p>
<p class='line0'>She feels that fear hath made her bold,</p>
<p class='line0'>That all her secret love is told</p>
<p class='line0'>For one who, calmly, saw her stand</p>
<p class='line0'>Betrothed in Broek-in-Waterland!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But love hath power, and bears the will</p>
<p class='line0'>To clear all doubts with matchless skill!</p>
<p class='line0'>Before the weeping maid I kneel,</p>
<p class='line0'>My own long cherished love reveal;</p>
<p class='line0'>Believing all, she checks her sighs,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, smiling, gently lifts her eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>To tell me why I saw her stand</p>
<p class='line0'>Betrothed in Broek-in-Waterland.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“With strangers I have dwelt,” she said,</p>
<p class='line0'>“For I’m a lonely orphan maid.</p>
<p class='line0'>They loved me not, and would have sold</p>
<p class='line0'>My hand to one who offered gold.</p>
<p class='line0'>I scorned him, for I knew his soul</p>
<p class='line0'>Was lost to virtue’s safe control.</p>
<p class='line0'>He was a stranger—born in Gand—</p>
<p class='line0'>No son of Broek-in-Waterland!”</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Yet hold! he was my friend,” said I;</p>
<p class='line0'>“I loved him well in days gone by.”</p>

<p class='line0'>For wealth, how steeped his soul in sin!</p>
<p class='line0'>How basely sought my hand to win!</p>
<p class='line0'>And vainly hoped to see me stand</p>
<p class='line0'>His bride in Broek-in-Waterland!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Why <span class='it'>vainly</span> hoped?” I quickly cried.</p>
<p class='line0'>“I scorned their power,” the maid replied—</p>
<p class='line0'>“I loved”—she paused—I knew the rest,</p>
<p class='line0'>And clasped her closely to my breast.</p>
<p class='line0'>I felt that she was truly mine,</p>
<p class='line0'>By honor’s law, by law divine,</p>
<p class='line0'>That none with shame our flight could brand,</p>
<p class='line0'>From hapless Broek-in-Waterland.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We never thought of storm or calm,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish that those whose vocation it is to tell stories would deal less in the details of human events, and give us
a glimpse, sometimes, of the hidden springs which move the human machine, and influence its volition.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In these stirring times of revolution and anarchy, of
experiment and discovery, of mighty changes and
astounding vicissitudes, it would seem as if a story so
simple and uneventful as that I am about to relate,
ought to be prefaced by an apology for its very simplicity.
But let the world wag as it may there will
ever be a few dwellers by the woodland brook, a few
sojourners at the cottage door, a few wayfarers along
the by-paths and green lanes of quiet life who will like
to listen to the “still small voice,” that counts the
throbbings of a single human heart amid all this sounding
tramp of nations. The tale of wild adventure and
startling incident charms us by its very wildness and
improbability—the story of life’s many-colored changes
draws us from our own commonplace cares—the glowing
record of passionate love comes to us like a realization
of our own early ideal, and for all these narratives
there are many readers. But who will ponder over
the quiet domestic details of a life which wasted slowly
away, unmarked even by the ordinary events which
checker woman’s tranquil existence, and colored with
so sober a gray that even the rose-tint of love’s romance
scarce brightened its dull hue? Who will read
such a record save those whose own life presents to
their remembrance the same sober volume of tear-blurred
pages? Earth holds too many such, but the
world knows not of them. Life has been to them a
monotonous round of anxiety and care—a November
day of clouds unbroken by a single sunbeam, and thus
youth passes away, and hope dies out, and in time they
forget their own identity, living on to old age with
their souls dead within them and their hearts dry as
dust. “The heart may break yet brokenly live on,”
but even this is happiness compared to the slow,
<span class='it'>chronic</span> heart-withering, which in its dull but certain
progress, leaves no remembrance of any healthier or
more vivid existence in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father of Minnie Clifton was one of those gifted
and graceful (too often also <span style='font-size:smaller'>GRACELESS</span>) persons on
whom society generally bestows the mysteriously
comprehensive epithet of “<span class='it'>fascinating</span>.” He was
exceedingly handsome, possessed many of those superficial
accomplishments which the indiscriminating and
good-natured world regards as the blossomings of
genius, and was master of the most perfect tact in the
display of his various gifts. It is in no wise extraordinary
therefore that the elegant Charles Clifton should
have been one of the most consummate “<span class='it'>lady-killers</span>”
of his time, and that the innumerable hearts he was
said to have broken, or at least cracked, during his
fashionable career should have won for him, among
graver people, the despicable title of a “<span class='it'>male flirt</span>.”
At the age of forty-five, when his credit with his tailor
was utterly exhausted, and when his <a id='too'></a>too faithful mirror
convinced him that⁠—</p>

<p class='line0'>“Years may fly with the <span class='it'>wings</span> of the <span class='it'>hawk</span>; but, alas!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;They are marked by the <span class='it'>feet</span> of the <span class='it'>crow</span>,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>he condescended to bestow himself upon a young and
pretty heiress, who eloped with him from boarding-school.
Fortunately for him, his wife proved to be
one of those tender, devoted, womanly creatures, who
never call in the aid of the head to destroy the illusions
of the heart. Her love for her husband long outlived
the qualities, real or imaginary, which had first called
it into being, and in the dull selfish egotist of the fireside
she could still see the brilliant and attractive man
of fashion who had won her gratitude by deigning to
accept her fortune and affection. When a woman is
won unsought, in other words, when she loves <span class='it'>first</span>,
she is always doubly enslaved by her affections, and
this was decidedly the case with Mrs. Clifton. She
fancied she could never do enough for her selfish husband,
and he soon showed himself the despot when he
found himself possessed of a slave. As he grew older
he became a martyr to gout, and in the slovenly, plethoric,
testy-looking, elderly man, who swore at his
pale wife fifty times a day, and kept his only child in
bodily fear by his fierce threats—none of his former
friends would have recognized the “<span class='it'>model man of
fashion</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the atmosphere of such a home, Minnie imbibed
her first ideas of womanly duties and womanly rewards.
She idolized her gentle mother, and that mother’s
idea of home duties and virtues was condensed
into one single article of faith—perfect submission to
the will of a husband and father. Mrs. Clifton’s mind
was too feeble, her experience too limited, and her affection
to her husband too extravagant to allow her to
entertain the slightest doubt of his wisdom or his virtue.
She honestly believed woman to be the inferior
creation, and her ideal of a wife was the patient Grizzel
of the old Fabliaux—a creature whose will, whose
wishes, whose very sense of duty was to be placed at
a husband’s mercy. That men might be found whose
noble, generous, self-forgetting affection would place
woman like a queen upon the throne of their hearts,
asking nothing in return but the enlightened and true
devotion of a loving nature, was an idea that never had
been presented to her imagination. She fancied that
hers was but a common lot, and therefore she early
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
trained Minnie to the servitude which she supposed
would accomplish her destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie inherited none of the rare beauty which had
been her father’s greatest charm. She had the soft
dove-like eyes, the pale clear complexion, and the peculiar
delicacy, almost fragility of frame which she
derived from her mother. These personal traits, combined
with her timid, gentle manner, her perfect good
temper, and quiet undemonstrative tenderness of nature,
made her seem merely one of those commonplace
children whom old ladies are apt to praise as good
quiet little girls. Yet Minnie had a fund of practical
good sense, together with a certain playfulness of
fancy, and a quick perception of the beautiful as well
as the good in life, which if properly trained and cultivated
might have made her a very superior woman.
But in her early home patience, good temper, and
industry were the only qualities called into exercise,
and neither her father nor her mother knew or
cared for any thing beyond the useful attributes in her
character. As she emerged from infancy, she gradually
became the little domestic drudge, for the rapid waste
of her mother’s fortune soon reduced them to the narrowest
mode of life, and when her father came home
from the club, where he could still keep up appearances,
to the small, ill-furnished house where his extravagance
had imprisoned his wife, it was Minnie
who waited on his caprices and ran at his call like a
servant. As he became diseased and still more reduced,
matters grew worse, and poor Minnie’s home
became the scene of discord and discomfort, as well as
the abode of positive want. Mr. Clifton grew into a
sick savage, Mrs. Clifton sunk into querulous discontent,
and Minnie was little more than the recipient of
the ill-humor of both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Minnie loved her parents dearly, and not a murmur
ever escaped her lips, however unreasonable
might be the demands upon her childish patience or
her limited time. But she was destined to a heavier
thraldom than that which nature had imposed. One
of those local epidemics which sometimes devastate
a neighborhood broke out near them, and both her
parents fell victims to it while she lay in a state between
life and death. When she recovered her consciousness
she learned that her father and mother had
been buried a week before, and she was now a poor
friendless orphan. The tidings, uncautiously communicated,
caused a relapse which brought her a second
time to the brink of the grave. But the principle of
life is wonderfully strong in youth, and after many
weeks of suffering Minnie was restored to health.
During her convalescence she gradually learned all the
circumstances of her bereavement from a kind and
careful nurse, in whose neat and pleasant apartment
she found herself domiciled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how came I here?” asked the bewildered
child, as she looked out upon the green fields that surrounded
her present abode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me answer you, my little cousin,” said a strange
but pleasant voice, as a tall young stripling entered the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The explanation was soon given. There was a
certain Mrs. Woodley, the maternal aunt of Mrs. Clifton,
who, offended at her imprudent marriage, had refused
to hold any intercourse with her. This lady had
a son pursuing his studies in the metropolis, who had
<a id='accident'></a>accidentally heard Minnie’s story told by a benevolent
physician. To Hubert Woodley such a story would
have been felt as a call upon his sympathies under any
circumstances, but when he found upon inquiry that
the child was his own blood relation, he acted promptly
and decidedly. Minnie was removed to healthy country
lodgings, and when all danger was over he wrote
to his mother requesting her to give Minnie a home with
her for the future. To his doting parents Hubert’s will
was law, and he was fully authorized to bring his little
cousin home as soon as her health would bear the
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How many people there are in the world who perform
all the duties of life, and apparently enjoy a fair
proportion of its pleasures, yet are as utterly deficient
in all that goes to constitute a warm, generous, sympathizing
heart, as if they had been mere animals! They
are like machines, moving with clock-like regularity
in their own narrow circle, doing exactly what their
“hands find to do,” but never seeming to suspect that
the head might suggest, or the heart might impel to
higher duties or broader responsibilities. Such were
the new friends who now came forward to claim the
friendless orphan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Woodley were dull, plodding, commonplace
people, who had begun life in a very small way,
and by close attention to the “day of small things,”
had grown moderately rich, exceedingly selfish, and
tolerably fat. Mr. Woodley had made his fortune by
such minute accumulations that he might perhaps be
pardoned for literally believing that</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Trifles make the sum of human things.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And to those who hold the belief in “predestinate
missions,” Mrs. Woodley’s taste for watching over
the trivialities of existence proved that she was born
“to look after candle-ends and cheese-parings.” As
soon as they had collected what they considered a competent
fortune they had retired to a country town,
where the attractions of a new brick-house, planted in
the midst of a broad and treeless meadow, proved irresistible
to the utilitarian tastes of both, especially as it
could be purchased at a low price. In this new home
the good couple had ample opportunity to gratify their
peculiar tastes. Mr. Woodley raised his own vegetables,
and occasionally was not above selling any surplus
produce of his land to a neighbor, while his wife
succeeded in making her house the very pattern of cold
formal neatness, merely at the expense of hospitality,
good-humor, cheerfulness, and everything like rational
or intellectual occupation. She scrubbed, and scoured,
and scolded, until she drove her single servant to desperation,
when a new one was found to go through the
same ordeal for awhile. She saw no company, because
it was expensive and troublesome—she went
no where because she was too busy at home—she enjoyed
nothing, not even her own neatness, because
there was always some mote in the sunbeam, or some
grain of dust in the air which either had, or would, or
might fall somewhere in the midst of her cleanliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
One only feeling seemed to have lived and thrived in
the stiff hard soil of these people’s hearts, and this was
their love for their only son. It is true it had required
the death of eight other children to concentrate and
condense parental affection into any thing like a sentiment
upon the remaining one, but all there was of love
in their natures was unreservedly bestowed upon
Hubert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such parents and in such a home Hubert might
well seem like a human sunbeam. He was one of
those light-hearted, merry-tempered, affectionate boys,
who are always such loveable creatures in early
youth, and whose characters are in after life entirely
formed by the mould and pressure of circumstances.
The only strong quality in his whole nature was ambition,
but this ambition was without fixed aim or purpose.
To go beyond his companions in whatever they
chose to undertake was his usual object, but he never
struck out a path for himself. His earliest friends had
become students, and therefore Hubert was a student
with them; his versatility and quickness of mind enabling
him to keep pace with plodding industry, and
sometimes even to emulate genius. He was tall, well-made,
and handsome, but a physiognomist might have
detected infirmity of purpose in his flexible, loosely-cut
lips, and phrenology would have turned in despair from
a head which exhibited such a deplorable want of
balance. But at eighteen Hubert was handsome
enough to satisfy a mother’s pride, and warm-hearted
enough to be agreeable to every one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hubert’s kind feelings had been especially called
forth by the desolate child whom he had rescued from
distress, perhaps from death. He looked upon her as
his especial charge, and the gratified self-love which
is apt to mingle with all our better feelings, made him
cherish her with unusual tenderness. But Minnie had
been so unused to kindness that she shrunk almost in
dismay from her cousin’s boyish gayety and boisterous
attentions. Disappointed by her cold quiet manner
and unconquerable sadness, Hubert soon ceased all
attempt to call her out from her shy reserve, and as he
soon returned to the city to resume his studies, Minnie
was left to learn the routine of daily duties by which
she was expected to repay her debt of gratitude to Mrs.
Woodley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie was twelve years old when she entered the
dull and quiet home in which she was thereafter to
dwell, apart from all companionship with youth, and
chained by the strong fetter of gratitude to the most
exacting of domestic despots. Timid, submissive in
temper, and meek, both from natural temperament and
from early experience of suffering, she was precisely
the docile, uncomplaining, unresisting slave that realized
Mrs. Woodley’s ideal of a poor relation. Of course
she was thoroughly and severely drilled into an intimate
knowledge of all the important minor duties of
life. Her early taste for books was diligently repressed,
her delicate perceptions of every thing good and beautiful
were sadly confounded by Mrs. Woodley’s practical
views of life, and from a child of great intellectual
promise, she was gradually transformed into a faithful,
unwearied, and industrious upper servant, in a household
where eating and drinking and house-cleaning
were such important objects of existence, that the
whole soul must be devoted to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus passed on the sunny years of childhood
and the beautiful days of early girlhood, while not one
ray of the sunshine, nor one gleam of the beauty ever
blessed the eyes and heart of poor Minnie. A dull
calm stole over all her faculties, and in time she might
have become the mere machine which her benefactress
could best appreciate, had it not been for the occasional
visits which Hubert Woodley paid to his quiet home.
Hubert was one of those restless versatile beings who
in early life often exhibit something so resembling
genius that they are allowed to indulge a sort of dreamy
indolence, which their friends mistake for the waywardness
of superior powers. He was something of
an artist, a little of a poet, an easy conversationist, and,
as he had really studied much, was certainly superior
to most youths of his age. But whether he would
concentrate himself upon any one pursuit, or whether
he would remain an idle dreamer, or whether, as his
father secretly hoped, he would finally centre his ambition
upon the rewards of wealth and become a man of
business, was yet doubtful. He deferred a decision as
long as possible, and it was rather to put off the necessity
of choosing a course of life than from any other
motive, that he determined to make the tour of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For more than four years Hubert wandered about
the world with a vague purpose and aimless projects,
happy only in escaping from the dull monotony of
home, until a long-continued illness, contracted by imprudent
exposure in the Campagna de Roma, at length
sent him to England in the hope of benefiting by the
skill of a celebrated physician there. During his stay
in that land of wealth and comfort, Hubert found himself
surrounded by new and powerful influences. He
had learned that he was not born to “build the lofty
rhyme,” and as he walked through the rich galleries
of art in Italy, he had discovered that he was not a
painter. What then was his destiny? He still had
his old restlessness of ambition, and felt that he must
be something in order to satisfy his own cravings. As
he stood on the quay at Liverpool, and looked abroad
upon the winged ships and crowded storehouses, the
mystery of his being was suddenly solved. Commerce
was the most liberal of deities to her true votaries, and
riches would command rank and control talent. The
same sudden impulse which had formerly made him
fancy he would be an artist, now decided him to become
a merchant and a man of fortune. He determined
to return to his native land and devote himself to business.
His next letter to his father made known his
present views, and while his father gladly made all
necessary arrangements for his new pursuit, Hubert
hastened his preparations for revisiting his long deserted
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an old proverb that “opportunity makes thieves,”
and I once heard an old maid say that “opportunity
makes wives;” one thing is most certain—that <span class='it'>propinquity
often makes lovers</span>. When Hubert returned he
found Minnie wonderfully developed in her personal
appearance. She was now nineteen, with a graceful
figure, a face combining delicacy of feature with great
sweetness of expression, and manners of the most winning
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
softness. Yet she was not one calculated to excite
admiration, still less was she a person to be fallen
in love with suddenly, but there never was a creature
so eminently fitted to glide quietly into one’s heart of
hearts as gentle Minnie Clifton. Hubert had seen much
of women while abroad, but a creature so like “the
angel of one’s home,” had never before crossed his
path. Had he met her in society she would have been
like a lovely picture placed in a wrong light, but in the
narrow circle of home every trait in her exquisitely
feminine character was unconsciously displayed to the
best advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Woodley, like all selfishly affectionate mothers,
had long dreaded the time when her influence over
Hubert would be superseded by that of a wife. Unwilling
to have him leave her for another home, she
was quite as unwilling to resign her authority, and sink
into merely the dowager dignity of “old Mrs. Woodley,”
yet her good sense told that she could scarcely
hope to retain the sceptre of power for many years
longer. Nothing could have happened so effectually
to disappoint her fears and brighten her hopes, as this
dawning affection of Hubert for his “little cousin,” as
he still called her. With a daughter-in-law so thoroughly
trained to submission, so docile, so perfectly
good-tempered, so exactly moulded after Mrs. Woodley’s
own model, she could have nothing to fear either
for herself or for Hubert. As for Mr. Woodley he had
become really attached to the quiet girl who aired his
shirts, mended his stockings, brought him his slippers,
and always made his second cup of tea quite as good
as the first. He wanted Hubert to marry and settle
down to business, but he hated change of all sorts, and
if Minnie became Hubert’s wife the whole affair could
be settled without either expense or trouble; therefore,
after talking the matter over with his good lady, it was
decided that nothing could have turned out better for
all parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie was the only one who was ignorant of these
new plans and projects. From the time when Hubert
had entered her sick-room, and uttered his kindly
greeting at the moment when she felt herself the most
desolate of human beings, she had regarded him as
something more than mere mortal. But when he returned
from Europe, so much improved in person, so
polished by society, and with a mind enlarged by travel,
she looked upon him almost with awe as well as admiration.
Unaccustomed as she was to kindness or
appreciation, it is not strange that she should have
been entirely unaware of Hubert’s growing attachment
to her. She felt that the atmosphere of her home had
become a more congenial one—she was conscious that
every thing had grown brighter even to her sad and
serious eyes, since he had taken up his abode among
them, but she did not dream of the individual influences
which were about to waken her to a new perception
of life and its enjoyments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the chief defect in Hubert’s early character was
indecision. He loved his cousin Minnie, but, somehow
or other, he hated to put it out of his power to change
if he pleased. He wanted to be unshackled by any
bond except his own inclinations, and feeling very sure
that no rivals could ever interfere with his plans, he
made no open avowal of his love for the present. He
devoted himself to business with an ardor that showed
he had at last found his true bent, and that money was
actually the true aim of his ambition. He lived a
lonely retired sort of life, being only one of the “singles”
in a large private boarding-house, and as he never
gave suppers, or went to parties, not even the servants
were interested in him. Once a month the stage set
him down within a quarter of a mile of his father’s
door, and then he found himself in the enjoyment of
all the attentions that could be lavished upon him for
the few days of his stay. To say that he beguiled the
time during his visits by making love to his cousin,
would be hardly fair, but he certainly said and did
things which a woman of the world, without any great
stretch of vanity might have understood as love-making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus passed on month after month, and Minnie was
unconsciously drinking deep from that fountain of
freshness which had so lately sprung up in her lonely
path, while Hubert lived in the full enjoyment of all
that sweet unconsciousness, which lent such a charm
to her manners, such new loveliness to her gentle face.
It was not until more than two years had passed that,
in an unguarded moment, he was led into such a warm
expression of his feelings as to require some decided
explanation. He then spoke out plainly and manfully,
avowed his love and asked Minnie to become his wife.
Terrified at the excess of her own emotions, shocked
at her own apparent ingratitude toward her benefactors
in being thus made happy by what she could not hope
they would approve, Minnie could only weep. But
when Hubert assured her that his parents would willingly
receive her as a daughter, she gave her whole
soul up to the enjoyment of such unlooked for bliss.
Yet, even in that moment of full unrestrained affection,
why did Hubert counsel silence for the present, and
secrecy until he should fix the moment for frank disclosure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Convinced that matters were going on as they
wished, the old people asked no questions. Perhaps
Mrs. Woodley was not sorry to defer the period which
would elevate Minnie from the humble position of a
poor relation into the condition of an equal, so Hubert
was allowed to manage matters in his own way, and a
stranger would have seen nothing in the manner of the
quiet family which portended any change among them.
Indeed to no one but Minnie herself had this new state
of affairs made any difference. To her, the sad and
lonely and unloved orphan, the consciousness of being
at last beloved for her own sake, lent a charm to every
thing in life. But her heart had been too early crushed
to regain the elasticity and buoyancy which ought to
have belonged to her youth. She was happy, deeply,
entirely happy, but no one could have suspected the
fervid thankfulness of her prayerful happiness, beneath
the quiet demeanor which had now become so habitual
to her. It was when alone, in the solitude of her own
chamber, that she gave way to the emotions which
almost overpowered her. It was on her knees that
she poured out the fullness of her joy to Heaven—it
was only for the eye of her Heavenly Father to see
the swelling surges of that sea of happy emotion,
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
which she was too timid, too self-distrustful to exhibit
to her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps there are no people so completely enslaved
by habit as those who are only moved by impulse.
Persons who have fixed principles of action govern
their lives by those principles, and habits are only the
secondary forms which those motives assume. But
when a man is thoroughly impulsive, and only to be
stirred through some strong emotion, a large part of
his life must be controlled through the unconscious
agency of circumstance and habit, unless, indeed, he
should be one of those human volcanoes, occasionally
to be met with, who are never in repose except the
moment after an explosion. Hubert Woodley was a
perfect exemplification of the apparently anomalous
fact that a man may have noble and generous impulses
yet be involved in a net-work of selfish habits. The
selfishness which he had inherited from both parents
was overlaid by so much that seemed good and beautiful
in his nature, that its existence was utterly unsuspected
by every one, and certainly unknown to
himself. Yet it was this very quality which had made
him ambitious at first of the renown of the scholar,
and afterward of the fame of the painter, and now actuated
him to seek after great wealth. Self was the
soil in which every thing grew, even the herbs of
grace, which embellished and concealed the base
source from whence they sprung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hubert loved Minnie as well as he could love any one
beside himself, but he knew nothing of that affection
which makes self a forgotten idea, and concentrates
the whole being upon another. His love had been
a fancy growing out of the novelty of finding so
sweet a flower in such an ungenial spot. Then the
desire of approbation, which had always been a latent
propensity with him, stimulated him to make love to
her. The vague stirrings of passion, the necessity of
some habitual stimulus to make home endurable, and
the cravings of an unoccupied heart made up the rest
of those mixed motives which led him first to stir the
quiet depths of Minnie’s half-frozen soul. He enjoyed
the excitement of her feelings, just as one might enjoy
their first glass of champagne. His brain was not in
the least bewildered, but the effervescence gave him a
new and pleasurable sensation. He liked to hear the
hurrying of her quiet footsteps as she came forward to
meet him at the door; he loved to see the flitting blush
come over her pale face when he took her hand in
his; and it was with a sort of epicurean pleasure he
felt the trembling of her shrinking frame as with an
excess of maiden reserve she would glide from his encircling
arm in some moment of endearment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But never once did Hubert reflect on the rights
which all these things were gradually giving her over
him. Never did he consider that those quiet depths
of affection which but for him would have been sealed
forever, were now destined to become a fountain of
sweetness, or a pool of bitter waters, according as he
directed their flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Months had now become years, and yet the relations
between the cousins remained unchanged. Living
amid all the gentle ministry of affection, Hubert
scarcely felt the want of any thing beyond what he
had already won. Minnie was tender, gentle and
affectionate, ever meeting him with a smile of welcome,
ever studying all his humors, never thwarting
his moods, never exacting any return except such as
his own whim might dictate; content if he was cold
and absorbed, grateful and happy if he was affectionate
in his manner; and Hubert certainly enjoyed some of
the pleasantest privileges of married life, without any
of its attendant evils, and therefore he was content to
go on year after year, heaping up money, of which he
had become exceedingly careful, and growing richer
every day, while his marriage seemed just as much
hidden in the mists of the distant future as it had been
years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But changes will occur in human life, not withstanding
all our efforts to prevent them. The Woodleys
had a sort of morbid dread of a wedding, but they did
not seem to remember that there might be such a thing
as a funeral to alter the aspect of affairs, until one fine
morning, just as Mrs. Woodley had succeeded in turning
the whole house out of the windows, preparatory
to what she called her “spring cleaning,” she was
struck with apoplexy, and died in a few hours. The
shock was a terrible one to the family, and in addition
to the grief of such a loss, the fearful quiet of the house,
now that the voice of the restless mistress was silenced
forever, pressed with overpowering weight upon the
spirits of the survivors. But there was little of the
sentiment of affection to embalm the memory of the
dead. Mrs. Woodley was buried, and under the direction
of Minnie the house cleaning was completed,
after which matters seemed to resume their old course.
Mr. Woodley said something to Hubert about “settling
himself,” and giving the house a mistress, now
that his poor mother was gone. But Hubert looked
down at his deep mourning dress, and seemed shocked
at his father’s irreverent haste in suggesting such ideas,
at such a moment. So nothing more was said on the
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, what thought, and what felt, and
what said Minnie? She <span class='it'>said</span> nothing—she <span class='it'>thought</span>
she was most unreasonable and ungrateful not to be
perfectly contented—she <span class='it'>felt</span> as if the best years of her
life were gliding away, and bearing with them the
youth, and freshness and cheerfulness which were her
chief claims upon Hubert’s affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten years had passed away since the quiet, half-acknowledged
engagement which bound the cousins
to each other, and opened for Minnie a vista of happiness
which seemed ever receding as life advanced.
Ten years had passed and <a id='min'></a>Minnie was certainly
changed. The unsatisfied yearnings of affection, the
wearing anxiety of hope deferred, the dull stagnation
of a life whose destiny seemed decided, yet never fulfilled,
all aided the work of time, and the thin, pale,
careful-looking woman of nine-and-twenty was only
the shadow of the quiet, gentle, graceful creature of
nineteen. Busied in accumulating wealth, Hubert had
scarcely noticed these gradual changes, but when the
shock of his mother’s death awakened his faculties,
and startled up his home feelings, <span class='it'>then</span> he beheld Minnie’s
faded face in the mirror of his own altered heart.
At thirty-four he was as handsome as ever, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
the lines of care which Mammon had stamped
on his brow. He was rich, too—rich even beyond
his hopes; he felt full of the energy of animal life, for
his health was perfect, and he began to fancy that he
had made a mistake in confining himself to so monotonous
a kind of existence. There was an uncomfortable
routing of conscience whenever he caught himself
thinking of Minnie’s faded looks, so, with his
usual palliating policy, he resolved to settle up his
business, spend a winter in Washington, and marry
Minnie the following spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His business was soon arranged, he retained a special
partnership in the lucrative concern, leaving all
responsibility in the hands of trusty persons, and, without
informing Minnie of his <span class='it'>final</span> intentions, set off on
his winter’s pleasuring. It was just as well that he
was silent on the subject, for it would only have increased
the turpitude of his conduct. His good looks,
pleasant manners, and great wealth, made him a favorite
in that emporium of speculation. His vanity, which
had been kept so long in abeyance by his love of
money, was called forth by the flatteries and attentions
of society. He was surrounded by beautiful and gifted
women; he lived in a constant whirl of excitement,
and the remembrance of his home, haunted by the
sad-eyed spectre of the woman he had once loved, became
utterly disgusting to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end of all this may easily be guessed. One
night Hubert sat until dawn, pondering over a letter
which he wanted to write, which he felt he must
write, yet which he knew not how to shape into words
without branding himself as a villain. At last the letter
was written and dispatched; he had not quite satisfied
himself, but it read thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I write to you, my dear cousin, because I want
you to inform my father of an event which may not be
altogether pleasing to him, but which you can soften
away so as to quiet any irritation he may feel. You
perhaps know, Minnie, that he has always wished <span class='it'>you</span>
to become my wife, indeed I partly made him a promise
to that effect, ages ago, at the time when you and
I had some boy-and-girl love-passages—do you remember
them, my little cousin? or have you forgotten
our moonlight rambles, and all our juvenile love-making
when I first returned from Europe. It seems to me
like a far-off dream, and yet it was only ten or twelve
years ago. Well—I was a romantic boy then, and
you as romantic a little girl—my father always liked
you, and fearing I might be led into bondage by some
strange <a id='del'></a>Delilah, he wanted to make a match between
us. My mother, poor soul, liked your housewifery,
and so she joined in the plot. Had we been married
<span class='it'>then</span>, Minnie, we might have been a quiet, comfortable
couple, treading in the footsteps of my honored
parents; I, daily growing pursy and plethoric, you a
matron, in all the dignity of lace-caps, growing more
learned every year in the management of children and
the making up of baby-linen. When I look back at
the past, Minnie, I can almost find it in my heart to
wish it had been so. But perhaps it is best as it is.
If under the excitement of my boyish passion I ever
said any thing to you, Minnie, which could involve
any bond between us, I pray you to forgive me, and
to attribute it entirely to my ignorance of my own
nature. We have lived on terms of the closest intimacy
ever since I found you, a little sick and suffering
child, without a friend or protector in the wide world.
It has been a bond closer than that of brother and sister,
because it had much of the peculiar piquancy
which belongs only to that sweetest of all relationships,
which early entitled me to call you my little
cousin. But I am dallying with old recollections,
when I should be telling you of coming events. I am
going to be married, Minnie; you will wonder when
I tell you that my bride has not yet counted her
eighteenth summer. She is the prettiest little fairy in
the world, and as artless as a child, indeed she has not
been <span class='it'>out</span> in society, so I have plucked the flower with
the morning dew yet fresh upon it. My father will
object to her youth, and will conjure up the image of
my mother, armed with her bunch of keys, the insignia
of her old-fashioned housekeeping. But you
must make my peace with him, Minnie. My intention
at present is to take furnished lodgings in New
York, where I can be near my business, which I mean
to resume as soon as this affair is settled. You will
of course remain with my father and watch over his
declining years, unless you should marry, when I shall
take care that a suitable provision be made for you.
And now, my dear cousin, having wearied you, doubtless,
as well as myself, with this long epistle, I bid
you adieu; trusting that my father may not be inexorable
under your kind ministry, I shall wait with some
impatience for your reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the heartless, yet craftily worded letter
which was put into Minnie’s hands, as she sat watching
beside the sick-bed of poor Mr. Woodley, who
had been stricken with paralysis, and now lay between
life and death. It would require a colder heart
and more graphic pen than mine to describe her feelings.
Fortunately for her Mr. Woodley was utterly
insensible, and there was no one to witness her emotion.
When the doctor came to visit the patient at
evening, he looked amazed at the change which he
saw, not in the sick man, but in the gentle nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are ill, Miss Clifton, suffer me to send a nurse
for Mr. Woodley, and let me persuade you to go to
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I am not better tomorrow, doctor, I will accept
your kind offer, but I would rather watch him to-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning the good doctor found Minnie
looking as pallid as a corpse, though she had now obtained
more control over her nerves. She refused to
give up her charge, but she requested the doctor to
write to Mr. Hubert Woodley and inform him of the
event which had befallen his father. In the course of
the following day came a Washington paper. With
trembling hands Minnie unfolded it and looked at the
list of marriages. She had conjectured truly; Hubert
had been married the day after he wrote the letter
which had crushed that gentle and loving heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s letter did not reach Hubert until his
return from his bridal tour. Leaving his wife among
her relatives to lament over the interruption which this
untoward event would necessarily make in her wedding
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
festivities, he hastened to his father’s bedside.
But Mr. Woodley had lost the use of every faculty.
He did not know his son—he could not lift his hand
to welcome him—all that remained to him of life was
the merest animal existence; he could take food and
sleep, but all hope of restoration to reason and the use
of his limbs was out of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may linger thus for years,” said the doctor, in
reply to Hubert’s questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hubert could ill bear to see his father’s distorted
visage, but it was worse, far worse, for him to look
upon the ghastly pallor which had settled on the face
of Minnie. She scarcely raised her eyes to his face,
and the hand she extended toward his proffered grasp
was cold and nerveless. He could not stand it. In
three days he was again in Washington, and as his
father was so accommodating as to live on, the round
of projected gayeties was not interrupted. Hubert
daily received tidings from the doctor respecting his
father, until it was decided that death was yet far distant,
and this living death might be dragged out through
many months, when all present anxiety ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first care was to secure a provision for Minnie,
hoping in this way to relieve his conscience of the terrible
load which weighed upon it. The house where
she had so long resided with his parents was secured
to her for life, together with a small annuity, to commence
at his father’s death, <span class='it'>on condition that she remained
with his father during the remainder of his
existence</span>. It was a cruel precaution, for Minnie
would never have dreamed of deserting her benefactor.
To look upon the ghastliness of death for the
rest of her life—to humor the caprices and minister
to the diseased appetite of a gibbering and restless
corpse (for such seemed the stricken man) was the
fulfillment of her destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For five years Minnie lived on in this dreary and
solitary manner, the helpless invalid and a single servant
forming the whole household. But it mattered
little to her now. A dull torpor had gradually crept
over her feelings. She was like an automaton, moved
by some other mechanism than that of her own volition.
Long ere Mr. Woodley dropped into the grave,
she had grown gray, and wrinkled, and bent, like one
in extreme old age. At length the end came. The
last spark of life went out, and Mr. Woodley was consigned
to darkness and the worm. Again Hubert
came to look upon the wreck he had made. She made
a feeble attempt to tell him her future plans. She
wished to enter a recently established charity for
“poor gentlewomen,” but the pride of the man of
wealth revolted at such a scheme. He refused to permit
her to depend on any other than himself for a support,
and Minnie felt that the time was past when she
could have earned her own maintenance. The last
remnant of her womanly pride was crushed by the
strong hand of him who had ruled her whole life with
a rod of iron. She lived a dependent on the bounty
of Hubert Woodley, dwelling in the house where he
had wooed her in her days of girlish loveliness, and
fed by the dole with which he had silenced his remorse,
until she had counted her half century of sorrow;
then, weary and worn out in mind and body,
she sunk into the grave, with none to mourn over her,
none to treasure any memorial of her existence. Hubert,
of course, took possession of her few effects.
He found among her papers a lock of sunny brown
hair, which he well remembered to have given her,
and the cruel letter which had announced his marriage.
There were no love-gifts—he had been too cautious
to commit himself by such trifles. As he sat alone in
that dreary old parlor, with its sombre paper, its dark
carpet, its high-backed perpendicular chairs, and that
dreadfully monotonous clock ticking as loudly as if it
would fain awaken the conscience of the solitary occupant
of that melancholy apartment, he felt a <a id='super'></a>superstitious
awe steal over him which he could not overcome.
He threw the letter and the lock of hair into
the smouldering embers of the wood fire upon the
hearth, and as the flame leaped up to consume those
remnants of the past, the drooping figure of Minnie
Clifton stood between him and the sudden blaze. A
wild cry broke from his lips, he started from his seat,
and at that moment a servant unclosed the door. To
the day of his death Hubert Woodley believed that by
the mysterious agency of fire, burning as it did into
the very soul of that mystery which involved the happiness
of a human being, he had called up the spectre
of the wronged and joyless object of his early love—the
victim of his selfishness—whose whole life had
been like a dull and dreary dream.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY RICHARD PENN SMITH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ibad the Dervise, instead of feeling proud in the
right of the Source of All Good, shrunk from his sight
as if unworthy of the hand that had fashioned him. He
did not worship as the birds and children worship, with
songs and joy, but he built himself a cell, and there, in
solitude, worshiped his God, amidst groans and torture
screaming—“Yahu, ya allah! I am not a Naeshbendee,
and live not among sinful men.” The birds and
the children in their simplicity thank the Prophet, and
even while dying sing their gratitude. Ibad worshiped
in suffering, believing that temporal torment, self-inflicted,
would be acceptable in the sight of him who
gave all to render man happy. The children and the
birds understand God’s dispensations better than did
Ibad the dervise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ibad slept and had a vision. He beheld a broad and
extended path over a verdant meadow, where balmy
breezes sported in the sunbeams. A stalwort figure
suddenly appeared, with head erect, front of pride, and
with eyes that quailed not while staring at the eye of
day. Onward he strode, and seemed to spurn even the
path he trod, and as he gazed at the sun, his shadow
that dogged his heels was tenfold his colossal stature;
yet the shadow was willing to follow, without an attempt
to lead the way. The figure was Ambition; the
shadow Dependence, hunting in his trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onward they strode. The pathway was strewed
with flowers and tempting fruit, when suddenly a fascinating
figure stept beside Ambition—it was Friendship,
and Friendship cast his shadow also—a shadow
as substantial as the substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four marched proudly on, Ambition, Friendship
and their shadows, and as they traversed the level
pathway they mutually laughed, self-satisfied—Friendship
smiled and simpered, while Ambition chuckled in
his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A change came over Ibad’s vision. The sun was
overshadowed, murky clouds hung over their path,
and Ambition entered a wilderness where no light
glimmered to guide him; he knew that Death had
spread a snare before every footstep; but he knew not
where the pitfall had been spread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ambition, as he entered this dark passage, looked up
to the heavens for light, but the sun was sleeping; he
turned to his gay companion Friendship who had prattled
over the flowery meadows in the sunshine, but
Friendship was not there; he looked behind him—all
was darkness, and even the sycophantic shadow that
had crawled at his kibes had deserted him. Ambition
exclaimed in bitter irony—“Can I not, in the dark day
of my progress leave even a shadow behind me!
Have both Friendship and my shadow vanished together
because a cloud is upon me! Forward; emerge
from the present gloom, and the sun will laugh in your
eye to-morrow, and then you will find Friendship with
his cheerful face, simpering beside you, and your shadow
will assume ten fold its former dimensions, will
mimick more accurately every motion of your body,
and stick more closely to your heel while you walk in
the sunshine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning sun arose, and as Ambition emerged
from his dark and thorny pathway, his road became
light, broad and fragrant. The fresh breeze was as
wine to his wearied spirit, and he winked and smiled
at the sun in the pride of his manhood. Friendship
came up smiling beside him, and as they again walked
together, their tall dark shadows followed closely
upon their heels, fantastically mimicking their motions,
as if even their shadows were endeavoring to deceive
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They now approached a precipice. Their path became
narrow, and still more narrow as they ascended,
until finally Friendship jostled Ambition in endeavoring
to maintain his foothold, at the same time striving to
take the lead. Even their unsubstantial shadows jostled
each other in like manner. “The path hath become
too narrow for us two,” cried Ambition, as he
coolly hurled Friendship headlong down the precipice,
without even casting a glance upon his destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was now alone, without even the shadow of
Friendship to sustain him; still onward he strode up
the dizzy height, while his own shadow, at every step,
diminished in its immense proportions. At length his
course was intercepted by a perpendicular barrier,
upon which there was no safe foothold. He looked
behind him and discovered that his shadow had departed;
he looked down upon his feet to ascertain upon
what safe pedestal he stood, and lo! there was nothing
more substantial than the heels of his shadow to sustain
him; its gigantic outline had dwindled to a pigmy.
He raised his proud head and exclaimed exultingly—“but
one daring leap is required to surmount this obstruction,
and then all will be sunshine!” He made
the leap; he touched the rocking pinnacle where
all his hopes were perched; his shadow, true to
him in sunshine followed, but he found no foothold
there, for in an instant he overtoppled and fell on
the other side, and he and his shadow disappeared
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is it so?” cried Ibad as he awoke. “Is the
path of life too narrow to admit of Friendship without
being jostled, and too dangerous for Ambition to tread
in safety; and must that proud being disappear as a
meteor, without leaving behind even a shadow of his
existence! Yahu, ya allah! Praise to thee! I am no
Naeshbendee, and live not among sinful men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ibad retired to his solitary cell, where he feared not
the selfish duplicity of Friendship, and as his sole ambition
was to worship the Prophet, he apprehended no
barrier in his pathway; and though he might disappear
from the eye of man as a shadow, he felt that the
shadow he had cast in this world would be gathered
up, and become substance in the sight of God through
eternity in the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rose, dear,” said Mrs. Carleton to her daughter,
whom she met at the door of the dining-room, with a
decanter of wine and glasses on a waiter, “who is in
the parlor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Newton,” replied the young girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young man from New York?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going to take him wine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is only hospitable to offer him some refreshment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carleton stood with her eyes resting on the floor
for some moments, in a thoughtful attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather think, Rose,” said she, as she lifted her
eyes to her daughter’s face, “that it would be as well
not to hand him wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, mother?” inquired Rose, looking curious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know nothing of the young man’s previous
life and habits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you say that, mother?” asked Rose, who
did not comprehend the meaning of what had been
uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may have been intemperate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother! How can you imagine such a thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing of him whatever, my child,” replied
Mrs. Carleton, “and do not wish to wrong him
by an unkind suspicion. My suggestion is nothing
more than the dictate of a humane prudence. I have
recently had my thoughts turned to the subject of intemperance,
and, by many forcible illustrations, have
been led to see that the use of even wine, unrestrictedly,
is fraught with much danger. We never can
know whose perverted taste we may inflame, when
we set even wine before guests of whose history we
know nothing. It is, therefore, wiser to refrain. But
you have left Mr. Newton alone, and must not linger
here. Do not, however, present him with wine.
After he is gone we will talk on this subject again;
when I think you will be satisfied that my present
advice is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose left the wine on the sideboard, and went back
to the parlor, wondering at what she had heard. After
the young man had gone away, she joined her mother,
when the latter said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seemed surprised at my remarks a little while
ago; and I was, perhaps, as much surprised when
like suggestions were made to me. But when, from
indisputable evidence, we become aware that our
actions may wrong others, we are bound by every
consideration to guard against such injurious results.
You know how painfully afflicted the family of Mr.
Delaney has been, in consequence of the intemperate
habits of Morton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Poor Flora! the last time I was with her,
he passed us in the street so much intoxicated that he
almost staggered. Her heart was so full that she could
not speak, and when I left her, a little while afterward,
her eyes were ready to gush over with tears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unhappy young man! So young, and yet so
abandoned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until I met him, as just said, I thought he had reformed
his bad habit of drinking,” said Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in order to refer to this fact that I mentioned
his name just now,” returned her mother. “He
did attempt to do better, and for some months kept fast
hold of his good resolutions. But, in an evil hour, he
fell, and his temptress was a young girl of your own
age, Rose. A few weeks ago he went to New York
on business. While there, he visited the house of a
relative, where wine was presented to him by a beautiful
cousin, and he had not the resolution to refuse the
sparkling draught. He tasted, and—you have seen the
result.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother!” exclaimed Rose, “I would not have
that cousin’s feelings for the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She acted as innocently as you would have done
just now, my daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she not aware of his weakness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Nor had she ever been told that for one
whose taste is vitiated, it is dangerous, in the highest
degree, to take even a glass of wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so glad that I did not offer wine to Mr. Newton!”
said Rose, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Newton,” returned the mother, “may never
have used intoxicating drinks to excess. He may not
be in danger from a glass of wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know nothing of his previous life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, therefore, it is wisest to take counsel of prudence.
This is just what I want you to see for yourself.
To such an extent has intemperance prevailed
in this country, that the whole community, to a certain
extent, have perverted appetites, which are excited
so inordinately by any kind of stimulating drink
as to destroy, in too many instances, all self-control.
Another case, even more painful to contemplate than
that of Morton Delaney, occurred in this city last
week. I heard of it a day or two since. A beautiful
young girl was addressed by a gentleman who had
recently removed here from the South; and her friends
seeing nothing about him to warrant disapprobation,
made no objection to his suit. An engagement soon
followed, and the wedding was celebrated a few days
ago. The father of the bride gave a brilliant entertainment
to a large and elegant company. The choicest
wines were used more freely than water, and the
young husband drank with the rest. Alas! before the
evening closed he was so much intoxicated that he
had to be separated from the company; and, what is
worse, he has not been sober for an hour since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a sad, sad thing!” exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is sad, sad indeed! What an awakening from
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
a dream of exquisite happiness was that of the beautiful
bride! It now appears that the young man had
fallen into habits of dissipation, and afterward reformed.
On his wedding night he could not refuse a
glass of wine. A single draught sufficed to rekindle
the old fire, that was smouldering, not extinguished.
He fell, and, so far, has not risen from his fall, and
may never rise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You frighten me!” said Rose, while a shudder
went through her frame. “I never dreamed of such
danger in a glass of wine. Pure wine I have always
looked upon as a good thing. I did not think that it
would lead any one into danger.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Even the best of things, my child, may be turned
to an evil purpose. The heat and light of the sun is
received by one plant and changed into a poison, while
another converts it into healthy and nourishing food.
Pure wine will not excite a healthy appetite, although
it may madden one that has become morbid through
intemperance. Here is the distinction that ought to
be made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not dangerous, then, to serve wine in promiscuous
companies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly. I did not think so a little while ago,
because the subject was not presented to my mind in
the light that it now is. To this custom I can well
believe that hundreds who had begun the work of restricting
their craving appetites owe their downfall.
Where all are partaking, the temptation to join in is
almost irresistible; especially, as a refusal might create
a suspicion against the individual that he was
afraid to trust himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be very careful how I offer wine to any one
again,” said Rose. “I would not have the guilt of
tempting a man to ruin upon my conscience for all the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more I ponder the subject,” remarked Mrs.
Carleton, “the more surprised am I at myself and
others. I invite some friends to an entertainment, or
to spend a social evening, and I serve wine to my
guests. Among them is a man who has fallen into
intemperate habits at one time of life, and whose
present sobriety is dependent upon his rigid observance
of the rule of total abstinence. He is, it may be,
the husband of my most cherished friend. I place
wine before him with the rest. He is tempted to
break his rule, and falls. Ah, me! How many hundreds
of such cases occur in our large cities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carleton was a widow in easy circumstances,
and moved in fashionable society. She entertained a
good deal of company, and did it in the fashionable
way. When gentlemen called at her house, wine was
invariably set before them; and when she gave parties,
wine was always served to her guests. But,
suddenly startled into reflection, she saw that the practice
was a dangerous one, and determined to abandon
it. On this resolution she acted, much to the surprise
of many of her acquaintances. Some said she was
“queer,”—others decided that it was a foolish notion;
while others pronounced her conduct positively absurd.
But she did not in the least swerve from her purpose.
Wine was no more placed before her guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visits of Mr. Newton to Rose, which at first
were only occasional, became more and more frequent.
A mutual attachment ensued, which ended in marriage.
No wine was provided at the wedding party—to
many a strange omission—and Rose observed that
at the parties given them by friends her husband invariably
let the wine pass him untasted. Curious to
know the reason for such abstemiousness, she one day,
some months after marriage, said to him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you never drink wine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question caused Newton to look serious; and
he replied in a simple monosyllable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you like it?” inquired Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; too well perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way in which this was said half startled the
young wife. Newton saw the effect of his words,
and forcing a smile said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When quite a young man, I was thrown much
into gay company, and there acquired a bad habit of
using all kinds of intoxicating drinks with a dangerous
freedom. Before I was conscious of my error, I was
verging on rapidly to the point of losing all self-control.
Startled at finding myself in such a position, I
made a resolution to abandon the use of every thing
but wine. This, however, did not reach the evil.
The taste of wine excited my appetite to such a degree
that I invariably resorted to brandy for its gratification.
I then abandoned the use of wine, as the
only safe course for me, and, with occasional exceptions,
have strictly adhered to my resolution. In a
few instances young ladies, at whose houses I visited,
have presented me with wine, and not wishing to push
back the proffered refreshment, I have tasted it. The
consequence was invariable. A burning desire for
stronger stimulants was awakened, that carried me
away as by an irresistible power. You, Rose, never
tempted me in this way. Had you done so, we might
not have been as happy as we are to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shudder passed through the frame of the young
wife, as she remembered the glass of wine she had
been so near presenting to his lips. Never afterward
could she think of it without an inward tremor. And
fears for the future mingled with her thoughts of the
past; but these have proved groundless fears, for Mr.
Newton has no temptation at home, and he has resolution
enough to refuse a glass of wine in any company,
and on all occasions. Herein lies his safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! refuse a harmless glass of wine?” will
sometimes be said to him. To this he has but one
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pure wine may be harmless in itself; so is light—yet
light will destroy an inflamed eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentle reader! allow me to introduce to your consideration
the characters of Mr. Brigs, (<span class='it'>soi disant</span>
Allen Brigs, Esquire,) and his distinguished lady Mrs.
Polly Brigs. Imagine a stout built, corpulent “five
footer,” with a very big head, on which there never
was hair enough to make a decent pair of whiskers,
and on which, consequently, rode a red wig, curled as
many different ways as the sunbeams point; with the
largest of all large noses, into which he incessantly—or
at least fifty times in each day—thrust the raw rappee
with no small degree of relish; little pop-eyes, just
large enough to see every body in church at one and
the same time; a blue silk vest, striped cassimere pantaloons,
a leviathian shad-belly coat, and a milk-white
cravat tied in a double bow before, and surrounding
a collar made <span class='it'>partly</span> of very coarse linen, and <span class='it'>mostly</span>
of very stiff starch, which came up on either side to
his ears, sustaining the equilibrium of his head. Of
course, his head could only move in two directions—backward
and forward—without manifest danger to
the implements of hearing thereto attached, all set off
by a pair of cork-sole boots six and a quarter inches
across the instep when on, the toes of which looked
right into the master’s face; and here you have Allen
Brigs—alias, Mr. A. Brigs, Esquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brigs had undoubtedly seen the eclipses of a
great many years. According to his own averment,
he had “waded through as many snows as there were
hairs on his wig;” and as he had repeated this averment
so many times, and nobody had ever evinced any
inclination to contest the point with him, he had persuaded
himself that he was <span class='it'>ipso facto</span>, a “very old
man.” Be this as it may, Mr. Allen Brigs was not the
man to be eschewed for his aged stupidity. He was
amusing and buoyant as a boy. He never took the
unnecessary trouble to correct himself for errors in
language, no matter how gross, but would leave that
to be done by any body who chose to “take it up.” If
he was asked if it was Jonah who swallowed the
whale, he would reply in the affirmative, and when
corrected, would invariably answer—“Zooks! it’s all
the same in Dutch—just <span class='it'>vice versa</span>, as the lawyers
say—that’s all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, Mr. Allen Brigs was a man not to be scared
by any “livin’ warmint,” two-legged, or four-legged,
male or female—a perfect man of the world in business—“a
real out and outer”—crushing all opposition to
his own schemes, and believing in his heart that every
body was a fool who did not coincide in all things with
him, Mr. Allen Brigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Brigs was some ten years the junior of her
partner in life, and was a lady in every sense of the
word. It was evident that she had <span class='it'>once</span> been beautiful,
but that once had been past a long time; and now,
where then dangled the glossy curls, (not <span class='it'>false</span> curls—girls
never wore false curls in those days,) she displayed
two huge bows of yellow ribbon. These were
necessary ornaments, however, for they were appendages
to a very neat frilled cap. Mrs. Brigs had never
been known to wear a stay-body frock, or a bustle—indeed,
such things were not then in fashion—she
never wore sleeves of the mutton-leg cut; nor were
they ever so tight as to render the arms useless members,
but always large enough and small enough to be
comfortable. Mrs. Brigs never could endure small
shoes—consequently, she never was compelled to endure
the pains incident to corns. She was an inflexible
knitter and darner, and though Mr. Brigs never had
but one pair of socks, they never had a hole in them,
because whenever the legs wore out she would leg
them, and when the feet wore out she would foot
them. Mrs. Brigs was so good herself—so artless and
unsuspecting, that she thought every body else was
good, and artless, and unsuspecting too. Mrs. Brigs
was literally the very woman for Mr. Brigs, and that
gentleman was the very man for Mrs. Brigs. Hence,
it can only be inferred that they lived happily together—so
happily, indeed, and contentedly, that they were
known but to be loved. A peaceful country village
was their home. A ten acre farm of fertile land,
through which murmured a dear, bright stream</p>

<p class='noindent'>was the <span class='it'>fee simple</span> property of Allen Brigs. A pretty
little white-washed house, almost hidden by the clustering
fruit-trees, was their humble tenement. A
handsome little garden, tastefully laid out, occupied the
space between the house and rivulet, and here Mrs.
Brigs sought recreation when burthened with the <span class='it'>ennui</span>
of knitting and darning. A cow and calf—a sow and
pig—a horse, and a yard full of poultry of every species,
composed the family stock. And with all these, and
nothing more, they were rich—rich in the honesty of
their own hearts which knew no covetousness—contentment
was theirs, and that was riches. They were
surrounded by kind neighbors—some affluent, but not
aristocratic. An athletic son of sixteen, and a beautiful
daughter of twelve, were their only offspring. Solomon
Brigs was his father’s sole help, but they managed
every thing to admiration. Nanny was a sweet tempered
child—affectionate and dutiful. Every body
loved her, and she loved every body. Notwithstanding
she was a country girl, there was a native, witching,
fascinating grace in her every movement. She
was so active, and gay, and cheerful—so full of life
and joy—and so mild and modest! She had never
known sickness: health flowed through every vein,
and glowed in her soft dark eyes and blooming
cheeks—and her smiling face was a sure index to
her pure heart. Her finely shaped head, and intelligent
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
forehead, bore testimony to her keen susceptibilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solomon was a smart boy—so said his knowing father;
and though he had made no higher attainments
than reading, writing, and cyphering to the single rule
of three, he knew how to plough the corn, and hill the
potatoes, and weed his sister’s flower-beds. He could
not solve a problem in mathematics, but he could jump
higher and hallo louder than any boy in the village,
large or small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanny was a proficient in the art of housekeeping,
but not in French, painting, &amp;c. &amp;c. She, too, could
read, write, and cypher, and Mr. Brigs considered that
enough book learning for <span class='it'>his</span> children. It was all <span class='it'>he</span>
knew, and there was danger in too much. But we
come now to give our characters a more conspicuous
place in the public mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one cold morning in December, when the
snow was thick on the ground, and a luxuriant fire
was blazing on every hearth in the village, and when
nobody living would have thought of visiting, except
Miss Lachevers, the housekeeper of John Doe, next
door neighbor to the Brigses, No. 10 Lachevers’ lane.
As I said, it was cold—extremely cold; but Miss Lachevers,
No. 10 Lachevers’ lane, did not regard cold
weather. Now, whether a <span class='it'>young</span> lady, living to the
age of forty odd, becomes invulnerable to the piercing
air of a December morning, or whether the young lady
in question was differently constituted from other people,
I shall not attempt to decide—probably the latter.
Nevertheless, on this same morning, almost as soon as
the sun showed his face, Miss Lachevers peeped in
at the door of Allen Brigs. Mr. Brigs was drying the
morning’s paper by the fire, while Mrs. Brigs busied
herself “clearing away” the breakfast table. Solomon
and Nanny were both reading from the same book,
the story of “Aladdin’s Lamp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good mornin’ to you,” said Miss Lachevers, introducing
her body as well as her head—“cool mornin’
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather,” replied Mr. Brigs senior, laying down the
paper and rubbing the palms of his hands hard enough
together to erase the skin. “Come to the fire, Betty—be
seated—have off your bonnet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The finishing clause of this address proceeded from
the voluble tongue of Mrs. Brigs; and Nanny arose
from her seat to hand Miss Lachevers a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t trouble yourself, child—I never have time
to sit. I must go back in one second. It’s trot, trot,
from mornin’ till night, with me. I just stepped in,”
she continued, turning her eyes on Mrs. Brigs, “to ask
you all if you’ve hearn the news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What news?” inquired Mr. Brigs senior, glancing
first at the paper on the chair and then at the early
visiter—“any body dead or dying—or any steamship
busted—or any thing of that species?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” said Miss Lachevers, “nothin’ of that
are character. But somethin’ more important and
<span class='it'>novel</span> than either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes were now turned toward the significant
countenance of Miss Betty Lachevers, who still remained
standing. Mr. Brigs senior, not exactly understanding
the application of the word “novel” to the
sudden intelligence of any thing new—having never
heard it applied to any thing but a book—requested
Miss Lachevers to explain herself. Mrs. Brigs insisted
that Betty should take a chair and tell all about it; and
Solomon and Nanny continued their reading, as if nothing
<span class='it'>novel</span> was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, raly,” said Miss Lachevers, drawing a seat,
and depositing her person thereon, “I haint hardly got
time to tell you. But it’s wonderful to think of. The
fact is, a young schoolmaster arrived in town last
night, and I hear it’s his intention to set up a school
here for the eddication of youth; and the worst of all
is, nobody knows who he is, or where he come from.
His name I heered, but I almost forgot it—it’s Dubbs—or
Grubbs—or Dobbs—or somethin’ like that. They
say he’s a wonderful genus, smart as can be, and full
of larning. He stopped at old Jenkins’s, cross the way—whether
he means to board there <span class='it'>I</span> can’t say—but
there he is. I s’pose we’ll get a peep at him to-day.
For my part, I should like to know why he put up at
old Jenkins’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A schoolmaster!” repeated Mr. Brigs, the elder,
with emphatic surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—a reg’lar built, yankee schoolmaster,” replied
Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to teach the children how that the earth revolves
round the sun, instead of the sun revolving
round the earth, and things of that extravagant natur’,
I s’pose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure he will,” said the young lady, “and
he’ll be after coaxin’ your children into his notions—see
if he don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he!” consequentially returned the old man—“Sol
has too much sense for any Yankee that ever
lived yet; and I guess Nanny will have enough to do to
larn of her mother. Not he!” and Mr. Brigs inflicted
two slaps on the left side pocket of his blue vest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Brigs sighed, and Miss Lachevers coughed—whether
for want of something to say, or to render
what she had said complete, it matters not—but
she coughed, and bidding a hasty adieu, left the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brigs settled himself down to read the paper,
and his lady settled herself down to her favorite exercise—knitting;
while Solomon and Nanny repeated to
each other surmises as to the probable appearance of
the new comer—his age—dress, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed away, and night came on. Tea was
over, and this happy little family had gathered around
the cheerful fire. A gentle tap was heard at the door,
and a voice pronouncing the simple word—“housekeepers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” responded Mrs. Brigs, and in came Mr.
Jenkins, followed by a young man apparently about
twenty-two, with black hair and eyes, straight, tall,
and erect, handsome, and of a genteel and prepossessing
appearance, who was introduced by his conductor as
Mr. Timothy Dobbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” said Mr. Jenkins, after being seated,
and taking an accurate survey of the premises, “has
come among us for the purpose, he says, of opening a
school. He is an orphan, of very superior endowments—brings
with him ample credentials of his
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
capacity, and expects to find patronage for his support
from the inhabitants of our village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dobbs bowed a concurrence in the remarks of
Mr. Jenkins, and hoped that Mr. Brigs could furnish
him with board and a convenient room in his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s it!” said Mr. Jenkins, recollecting the
object of his visit—“that’s what we’re a coming to.
This gentleman, Mr. Brigs, wishes to reside in your
family, and to eat at your table, sir. I hope—I s’pose
you can accommodate him, Mr. Brigs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brigs said that he could, and that he should be
happy to serve him, Mr. Dobbs, in any other manner
possible. Matters being thus considered, and terms
agreed on, Mr Jenkins arose to depart; having first
satisfied Mr. Dobbs that he, Dobbs, would be sure to
sleep soundly that night, and assured him of the total
absence of all danger from external assaults under the
roof of so great and good a man as his friend and
neighbor Allen Brigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before retiring to rest, Mr. Dobbs acquainted himself
with the characters before him, by conversing
with them, and each of them, on various topics; and
found to his satisfaction that they were kind and noble-hearted
people. The characteristic traits of Mr. Brigs
were rough and unique, yet there was a generous
frankness about him—such a flow of spirits and good
humor—that he considered him a pleasant man. Nor
was Mrs. Brigs unlike her husband in these particulars.
To tell the truth, Mr. Dobbs was pleased. More
than once did he get a full view of the sweet face of
Nanny; and more than once did Nanny blush to catch
his eye. Timothy admired her modest looks, and
fancied that he <span class='it'>might</span> one day love her. He wondered
how old she was, and blest his luck that he had fallen
into that particular family, where such a beautiful face
as hers might shed its sunny smiles about him—perhaps
to cheer many of his tedious moments. He
fancied she <span class='it'>must</span> be young, yet she seemed already
expanding into womanhood. Such perfect symmetry
of form, and grace of carriage, he had never seen in a
country girl: and then the rich intelligence that beamed
through her soft dark eyes, convinced him that she was
born to follow some more noble pursuit than housewifery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hour grew late, and Timothy bade good-night,
and crept softly to his room, where fatigue soon lulled
him to sleep. But he dreamed! Yes, he dreamed of
one sweet angelic being, whom he had only seen
once—only once—and that sweet being was Nanny!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zooks!” said Mr. Brigs, after Timothy had left the
parlor—“but he seems to be a clever youth. Nanny,
what do you think of him—eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, father,” replied Nanny—“but—I
think—he’s quite handsome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handsome! Yes, and I reckon he considered
Miss Nanny Brigs a leetle specimen of the handsomest
girl he ever saw. I saw him a squintin’ on that side
of the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father!” cried Nanny, faintly blushing. “I’m
sure he <span class='it'>looked</span> at us all—he looked at Solomon, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s his name, father?” inquired Solomon—“Stobbs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dobbs—Timothy Dobbs, I think, and that’s all I
know about him yet: but we’ll find what kind of a
chap he is soon, I guess. I expect he’s a squirt, any
how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not,” said Mrs. Brigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I hope not, too,” rejoined Mr. Brigs; “but
we’ll see!”</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>Time sped on. The village school was in a flourishing
condition. Pupil after pupil had been added to the
charge of Mr. Timothy Dobbs, the “great unknown,”
until (to use a cant phrase) he had his hands full. It
is very natural to suppose that our village schoolmaster
had become very popular among all the villagers,
and particularly so in the discerning eyes of
Miss Betty Lachevers, No. 10 Lachevers’ lane. Notwithstanding
the violent protestations of Mr. Brigs
against the idea of suffering his children to become
scholars of Mr. Dobbs, the old gentleman had confessed
his wrong in that respect, and now protested with the
same vehemence, that Mr. Timothy Dobbs was the
finest fellow that ever lived; and that it would be high
treason in any parent or guardian to refuse children
and wards generally, the benefits of Mr. Dobbs’s seminary
of learning; and he (Mr. Brigs) was firmly of the
opinion that Solomon and Nanny would one day
become the successors of their tutor in the office
of “eddicating youth;” and on this hypothesis,
he built the future prospect of the erection of the
“Brigs’ College,” to be called after his own name, and
of which, as a matter of course, Solomon was to be
principal professor. Mr. Brigs saw all this as clear as
a whistle, and he had no doubt that his prophecy
would be fulfilled. Mr. Dobbs continued to board and
lodge at Mr. Brigs’ house. Nanny grew more lovely
and interesting every day, and made rapid advancement
in her studies. Solomon declared that Mr. Dobbs
paid more attention to his sister than to any other
young lady in the school—to her instructions he meant;
and that he believed seriously, that Mr. Dobbs had a
notion of making her his assistant—in the school he
meant. Miss Lachevers always happened to hoist the
window of Mr. Doe’s parlor at the particular moment
when the schoolmaster, Nanny, and Solomon passed
the gate, on their return from school; and as it was as
invariably the case that Mr. Dobbs walked closer to
Nanny’s side than Solomon’s, the former young lady
never failed to give her features an expression of scorn—at
least, whenever her eye met Nanny’s. It might
have been necessary for Miss Betty to hoist the window
on all these occasions, for some domestic purpose,
such as dusting, &amp;c., and therefore she could not help
seeing the passers by; she, however, at such times
looked unusually prim, but Mr. Dobbs seemed, in
every case, unconscious that the eyes of any third
person were upon him, for he never turned his on
either side, but looked straight forward. One day
Nanny actually had her arm in that of the schoolmaster,
when the walking was very bad on account of
snow, and then Miss Lachevers looked daggers, and
from thenceforth her deportment toward our innocent
heroine grew cold and formal. Perhaps Miss Betty
had different views of village etiquette from other
young ladies, and thought it extremely rude for a young
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
lady to lock arms with a gentleman, under an acquaintance
of four years and a half; or perhaps she considered
the law of primogeniture applicable to her individual
case, and thought that if <span class='it'>any</span> body was to lock arms
with the schoolmaster, it should be herself, as she was
<span class='it'>rather</span> older than Miss Nanny Brigs. Nevertheless,
she did not make her visits to Mr. Brigs’s less frequent.
She would sometimes—though altogether accidentally—chance
to “fall in” when Mr. Dobbs was there;
and whenever that event occurred, she made herself
extremely agreeable—so she thought. But Mr. Dobbs
was a sober-minded man, of keen perception and sound
views of propriety, and could read her writing as well
as she could herself. Nor was it long ere his disgust
was manifested at her sociable behavior, which caused
her to bestow upon him the classic epithet of “itinerant
pedagogue.” And now matters took another turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year had passed away since the “itinerant pedagogue”
first opened his school. The population of the
village had considerably increased. Uncle Sam had
established a post-office there. Lachevers’ lane was
become the principal thoroughfare of the “town.”
Stores—groceries—and tailor’s shops had been erected;
sign-boards hung out and nailed to the window shutters.
A handsome church “with tapering spire,” and surrounded
by young trees, was now the Sabbath rendezvous
of the villagers. The school-house had been
enlarged—the play-ground enclosed—and every thing
wore a new aspect. Miss Betty Lachevers, after exhausting
all her efforts to captivate Timothy Dobbs, had
abandoned him to the more attractive charms of Miss
Brigs; and the former young lady was now scarcely
ever seen, save at church on Sundays. A Sabbath-school
had been opened in the basement-room of the
village church, of which Timothy was superintendent,
and Solomon and Nanny teachers; and the signs of the
times bade fair to verify the predictions of Mr. Brigs
with regard to colleges, &amp;c. in general. But, still <span class='it'>all
was not right</span>! Timothy had declared his love to
Nanny, and had received an answer of satisfaction.
He had solicited the consent of her parents, and had
received a <span style='font-size:smaller'>REFUSAL</span>!! Not that Mr. Brigs thought him
unworthy of the hand of his daughter, but because his
history was still enveloped in mystery and obscurity.
Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Brigs, and Mrs. Jenkins and
Mrs. Brigs, and half a dozen more misters and mistresses,
had used all means to find out his origin, but
to no effect. He would always, when spoken to on
that point, fall into a state of dejected gloom, and evade
all questions bearing on his nativity; and this was a
barrier which intervened between him and the object
of his affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large oil painting ornamented the wall over the
fire-place, representing a young mother, with an infant
on her breast, reclining on the left arm of a man, who
was defending her with his right, from the assaults of
a ruffian. A beautiful girl lay weltering in blood near
the surviving group; and the husband seemed to have
received several dangerous wounds, from which large
drops of blood were falling. It was a scene of deep
and thrilling interest, and expressive of some awful
tragedy. It was also well executed, and the languishing
despair which beamed from the face of the young
mother would almost seem, at times, to convert the
painted canvas into a mass of animation. At this picture
Mr. Dobbs was often seen to gaze with sad countenance
and quivering lip; while the throbbings of his
temples told that the mind was at work with melancholy
thoughts. He became sad and cheerless,
avoided all company (but Nanny’s) as much as possible,
and was sometimes found weeping. Yet none knew
the cause of his silent grief. Nanny observed the
effect which had been wrought on him by the picture,
and communicated the fact to her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems,” said she, “to take a sad pleasure in
looking at the painting. He showed me a miniature
yesterday, which is the express image of the lady with
the infant child in her arms; and when I had examined
it, and returned it to him, he pressed it to his lips, and
the tears fell from his eyes. There must be something
strange connected with his history!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did he say nothing about the miniature or the
painting?” inquired Mr. Brigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing!” replied Nanny, “I saw the subject gave
him pain, and I feared to ask him any thing about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the miniature?” asked Mrs. Brigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He keeps it in his vest pocket,” answered Nanny.
“I will beg him to show it to you, mother—I know he
will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child—don’t. I will inquire into the secret
myself. But Nanny, did you never hear the story of
the painting over the fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Nanny; “what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! it’s an awful thing—all true as Gospel—dreadful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mrs. Brigs requested her daughter to ask her
no questions, and she would tell her some other time.
The young girl’s fears were excited, but she concealed
them within her own bosom.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Dobbs,” said Mrs. Brigs one evening, “what
on earth ails you? You look like you have lost the
best friend you had in the world. Do pray tell us
what has made you so gloomy for so many days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timothy sighed deeply, and a crimson flush suffused
the cheek of Nanny. Mr. Brigs turned up his collar,
and ran his fingers through his gray locks, and looked
very hard at Mr. Dobbs. Solomon looked very hard
at his father; and Mrs. Brigs looked at every one in the
room alternately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Mr. Briggs—“Come, Mr. Dobbs,
let’s hear what’s the matter. Remember, young man,
you are among friends; and if I can do any thing for
you—why, I’ll do it. Come, now, let out. Don’t
kill yourself for no trifle, young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel much obliged to you,” replied Timothy,
“and will ask but one favor. I cannot now tell you
what ails me; but there is something in this house
which gives me great anxiety. I have long wished to
make the inquiry, but had not the courage. Tell me,
then, what is the meaning of that picture which hangs
before me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zooks!” cried Mr. Brigs, “and is it the picture
that has caused all your bad feelings, Mr. Dobbs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” returned the schoolmaster; “and I wish to
know what it means!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
The surprise of Mr. Brigs and Solomon may be better
imagined than described. The old gentleman drew
out his red silk handkerchief and rubbed his eyes,
stuffed it into his pocket again, and stared with all his
might right into the schoolmaster’s face. Solomon
stared also; and laying down the book he was reading,
prepared himself to hear something strange. Mrs.
Brigs and her daughter were before partially acquainted
with the cause of Timothy’s disease—at
least, they knew that it sprung from the oil painting in
question. All was now deep interest, awaiting the
development of some wonderful discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Mrs. Brigs, “it’s a solemn thing that!
It used to make me sick to look at it; but it’s a long
time since it was hung up there, and I’ve got used to
it. Still it sticks deep into my heart—it does! It tells
a sad story—but you shall hear it, Mr. Dobbs!” And
Mrs. Brigs began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not give the reader the story in the very words
in which Mrs. Brigs gave it to Timothy; because that
is impossible: for she paused more than once to wipe
away the big tears, and to sob; and was obliged to
commence afresh as many as three times before she
satisfied herself that she was in the right path, and had
begun at the beginning. But, as I said, she began,
and the following is the substance of the narrative:</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE STORY OF THE PICTURE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>John Bloomfield, a merchant of London, was the
father of two children, to wit: Arthur Bloomfield and
Polly Bloomfield, now Polly Brigs, wife of Allen
Brigs. He came to this country about two years anterior
to the commencement of the Revolution, and settled
on a handsome country-seat, near the place where
now stands our village. Mrs. Bloomfield died during
the passage across the Atlantic; so John Bloomfield
was a widower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of his migration Arthur was twenty and
Polly sixteen years of age. The latter was shortly
afterward married to Mr. Brigs; and the widowed
father dying, Arthur determined to sail for the West
Indies, for the purpose of trading on the capital inherited
from his father, which amounted to some five
hundred pounds sterling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within one year after he left America, he heard that
the long expected conflict between the two nations had
begun, and being fired with a love of liberty, he returned
home to join the army of Washington, to aid in
repelling the invaders from the American soil. He
brought with him a young and lovely wife, who,
shortly subsequent to his return, gave joy to his heart
by the birth of a son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sister of young Mrs. Bloomfield, a still more
lovely girl, accompanied her brother-in-law hither;
and so beautiful was she, that many gallant knights
paid homage at her shrine. Alice was modest—pleasing—fascinating—and
none saw her but to love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur fitted up the late domain of his deceased
father; and leaving his family, soon after the birth of
his son, under the supervision of his wife’s sister, prepared
himself for a season of warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brigs was settled where he now resides, but
his was then the only tenement in existence there: so
Mr. Brigs may be considered as the founder of the village.
With the property obtained by marriage he purchased
the soil on which he built, together with such
implements of husbandry as present wants required.
The distance of two miles intervened between the two
families—consequently, they enjoyed the intercourse
of neighbors, though it was not very frequent that
they interchanged visits. They were, however,
neighbors, and Mrs. Brigs ministered, as much as in
her lay, to the wants of Mrs. Bloomfield during her
confinement.</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle of death was drawing to a close. Arthur
Bloomfield had returned to his family, and was
happy—happy because his life had been shielded amid
the strifes of war—happy because health was again
the property of Mrs. Bloomfield—happy <span class='it'>because he
was a father</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One calm evening in spring, when a thousand blushing
flowers</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Distilled sweet fragrance through the air,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and when all nature reflected the smiles of God’s benevolence,
Arthur Bloomfield was seated with his
family in the shady alcove, recounting the dangers to
which he had been exposed, and from which Providence
had rescued him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said he, “let us bow ourselves before
God, where we are, and return him thanks that we
are all again together.” And they fell upon their
knees on the green grass, while the father breathed
forth his gratitude to his Maker, in a slow, touching,
solemn prayer. Tears stood in the eyes of Alice, but
she wiped them away with her soft hand, and the
mother presented her infant boy before the throne of
Heaven, for a blessing before she arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden report of fire-arms threw a shock on the
frames of the two females, and caused a deadly paleness
to overspread the countenance of Arthur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy!” shrieked Mrs. Bloomfield, clinging to
her husband. “What can it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be composed, dear,” returned the man; “this arm
shall defend you!” And taking the child in his arms,
he led the way quickly to the house, where, securing
themselves within doors, they awaited the final issue.
Mr. Bloomfield armed himself with a sword, and
planted his stand at the open window, where he could
overlook the foreground, and detect approaching
danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon shone brightly, lighting up the landscape
with her mellow beams, and shedding rays of grandeur
on the world. There he stood, the only earthly
protector of his wife and son and sister-in-law, hardly
daring to hope success, in the event of an attack from
a nightly assassin; while the fear-stricken females
breathed heavily and tremulously near his back.</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<p class='pindent'>That night of blood and death passed away, and the
first beams of the morning sun penetrated the dismal
room where lay the bleeding bodies of three mortal
beings—a husband—a wife—and youthful maiden!—The
infant son was not there: the murderers had
borne him away, and no traces of them could ever be
found!</p>

<hr class='tbk124'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
When the spring flowers again sent forth their fragrance,
and the twittering birds began to build their
nests, and when the ice and snow of winter had melted,
and bud and blossom made the forest green; and the
winds blew softly and pleasantly; and when every
thing told that the cold season was gone, and sweet
spring had come, busy preparations were going on
throughout all the village for a wedding. Every little
house, and tree, and fence had been newly whitewashed.
The church steeple looked whiter than when
first built, and every face beamed with a brighter
smile, and every cheek glowed with purer health than
ever. And whose wedding was it? Rumor abroad
said it was one Mr. Dobbs, a schoolmaster, who was
about to espouse the pretty Miss Brigs. But all the
villagers <span class='it'>knew</span> that the parties to be joined in wedlock
were Mr. Timothy Bloomfield (formerly Dobbs)
and his sweet cousin, Miss Nanny Brigs, daughter of
Allen Brigs, Esq. Miss Betty Lachevers, on hearing
the degree of relationship between the “itinerant
pedagogue” and Miss Nanny, had become perfectly
reconciled to everybody, and to Miss Nanny in particular,
and the day previous to the wedding it was
generally understood that Miss Betty Lachevers was
to be “chief cook and bottle-washer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning of the 15th of May, seventeen hundred
and—no matter what—was clear and beautiful. The
church-bell began to ring, and the villagers began to
pour forth by two-and-two, dressed in their best, and
each bearing a bouquet of richest flowers. They all
proceeded to the house of God, where before earth
and heaven, the pious minister united two pious hearts,
between which there existed an attachment “sweeter
than life and stronger than death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zooks!” said old Brigs, on this happy occasion,
“I always thought well of the boy, but I’ll eat my
hat if ever I thought he <span class='it'>was</span> my nephew, and <span class='it'>was to
be</span> my son. Well! well! well!” And Mr. Brigs
looked as pleasing as he knew how. Mrs. Brigs
looked pleasing too. Solomon looked saucy at his
sister, and she blushed and looked saucy at Solomon.
Timothy felt as happy as ever man felt: and all was
joy and life and gayety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks more, and a petition was presented to
the Legislature of one of the New England States,
signed by one hundred and fifty inhabitants of the village,
praying for an act incorporating the “Classical
Seminary of S.” and within a few more weeks the
“Classical Seminary of S.” was filled with pupils;
and Mr. Brigs <span class='it'>lived</span> to see his prophecy fulfilled;
and <span class='it'>died</span> to be mourned by all who had ever known
him.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OR HOW TO SELL A CLOCK.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>(FOUNDED ON FACT.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, can I sell you a clock to-day?” inquired
a pedler, as he was met at the door by the woman of
the house at which he had stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the woman, civilly, yet decidedly,
“we want no such article.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have several fine clocks, madam,” said the pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” said the woman, “but we want
none”—at the same time retreating a few paces from
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask,” inquired the pedler, advancing within
the door a little, but cautiously and civilly, as the
woman retreated—“may I ask, madam, whether you
have a clock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman cast I will not say an indignant look at
the clock-man—but a look certainly not kind; at the
same time saying with some spirit—“we want none
of your clocks, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedler took a seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene which we have thus briefly described
occurred, some years since, in the “Old Dominion;”
but in what particular section we are not at liberty to
say. The house at which it occurred was a well-looking
habitation; old, indeed, but kept in clever repair.
It was owned and occupied by a farmer of some
consideration in those parts, but singular and very set
in his way. Like some others, in other quarters, he
had imbibed strong antipathies against Yankeedom and
all its inhabitants. He fairly hated the sight of a pedler;
and, although disposed to treat his species with
civility, he had not at all times been so fortunate as to
do so. In several instances, indeed, he had dismissed
with some severity these itinerant merchants, who had
offered their commodities for sale within his precincts.
Even his dog seemed to know when one drove up,
and snarled and growled with more than ordinary
spirit, to the evident satisfaction of the master. As to
purchasing an article of any of the detestable fraternity—that
he would never do—no not he, whatever were
his necessities. And he was true to his word. For
more than once, it had happened that articles had been
offered just at a time when he needed them, and
which could not be obtained in the retired situation in
which he lived—but he would not even look at them.
The corn might remain unhoed, and the house never
be swept, before he would purchase a hoe or a broom
of a pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentiments of Mr. M——, moreover, had obtained
no small notoriety among the pedling fraternity.
They all understood the matter—those we mean who
conducted this sort of trade in those parts; and although
several, prompted by a more than ordinary share of
confidence in their selling powers, had made a visit to
the place, determined not to leave the game</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Till they had run it down,</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>they had all to a man been foiled. The Virginia farmer
was proof against their strategy. In general, he was
civil—but he could be stormy and tempestuous, especially
if urged by a traveling merchant to purchase,
when he had peremptorily refused. And so set had
he become, that on more occasions than one, he had
urged his wife never, in his absence, to purchase any
article, especially not a clock. I am not certain that
in terms he had forbidden her. But she knew his
wishes; and being a good woman, she intended to act
accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day we are speaking of Mr. M—— had gone to
a neighboring town, a few miles distant, to transact
some business; expecting, however, to return the
same evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after his departure, which was early, the
pedler of whom we have already made mention drove
up, with the hope of disposing of a clock. Whether
he was apprised of the absence of the lord of the manor
has not transpired; but he was not ignorant of the
task before him. He had received ample information
from several of the profession of the unlucky star that
presided, when they made the experiment; and, moreover,
they had predicted his similar ill success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said he—“I’ll try my hand, and if
Jasper C. fails it will be the very first time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jasper C. was in truth no ordinary specimen of
a Yankee. Whether from New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
or Vermont, he scarcely knew himself, as in
all those States his parents had lived—but in the limits
of which one they happened to be, at the precise time
he first opened his eyes on this mundane sphere, he
never could quite ascertain. He had all the tact and
shrewdness of the Codfish State, and all the hardness
and impenetrability of the Granite State—and I may
add, all the determination of a Green Mountain boy.
If there was only a nook or angle where these States
could unite, that would be the precise spot—the very
sharpest point I mean—where Jasper C. had his beginning.
But however these matters may be, he was
a Yankee—and one of the “straightest sect”—a keen,
sharp-sighted, ready-witted man, of some two or three
and twenty. He was a great tactician at selling—no
matter what was the article or commodity, he could
always sell; and he delighted in nothing more than to
follow hard upon a brother pedler, and to compare
notes with him at the end of their common tour.
Generally, Jasper could show more dollars taken in a
given time than any brother pedler who traveled in
the “Old Dominion.” He had some confidence, therefore,
and he had a right to it. And, besides, his personal
appearance was in his favor; but what was of
more consequence, he was well-mannered. He was
seldom put off his guard, and seldom betrayed into
language which he had occasion to recall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was Jasper C——, the pedler, who made his
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
appearance at the house of Mr. M——, at the time and
under the circumstances already named.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had made known his errand, and had received a
denial. Most pedlers would have retired. <span class='it'>He</span> took a
seat. There was a seeming rudeness in so doing,
especially as the woman had given no such invitation;
but the manner of his doing it divested it of all impropriety.
It was taken hesitatingly and with an appearance
of weariness; and still more in his favor, he did
that which is not always done by pedlers, he civilly
removed his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minutes passed—or they seemed minutes to the
pedler—during which he sat in silence pondering upon
the course most likely to ensure success—the woman,
meanwhile, employing herself in brushing the hearth,
adjusting the chairs, with other operations indicated
by that very expressive household term—“putting
things to rights.” At length Jasper C—— ventured
to say, “Madam, with your leave, I’ll show you one
of my clocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may show as many as you please,” said the
woman, “but we want none—havn’t I already told
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, indeed, so told him; but, nevertheless, the
pedler had done better than he feared. He had gained
one point, and what his experience had taught him
was an important point—he had permission to show
his clocks. In a short time, therefore, he was again
entering the door, bearing in his hands a handsome-looking
clock—brass wheels, mahogany case, gilded
at various points, and withal a pretty landscape, painted
on a glass in front, below the face. In short, it was a
fair specimen of Jerome’s best Bristol made. Fortunately—so
the pedler thought—the mantle happened
to be unoccupied, and there, in the centre, the clock
was duly installed. It was wound up, and soon began
its duty—click, click, click.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedler resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said he had gained something. So he thought;
but despite of all that he had done, the woman seemed
as unmoved as a marble statue—she took not the
slightest notice of him, or his clock. This was strange.
The pedler thought so. He had encountered adverse
circumstances before—had doubled many a point of
difficulty and perplexity, and forewarned and forearmed
had expected to meet on this occasion, perhaps refusal;
but he didn’t well know how to manage such
sheer indifference. He would have tasked his wits—and
he did task them; but somehow they seemed to
forsake him at the precise moment, when he singularly
needed their assistance. Moreover, in the very midst
of his perplexity, the woman, who had taken a seat
with her back turned toward him and his clock—a position
which, under ordinary circumstances she would
have avoided as a breach of civility—rose of a sudden,
and taking some needle-work which she had in her
hand, wended her way through an adjoining door into
some other part of the house. It seemed as if she intended
to carry her plan and purpose of marked indifference
to the <span class='it'>ne plus ultra</span>; and the pedler would
have given up all hope of success but for one circumstance—quite
a trivial one—and yet it left a hook to
hang a hope on. As the door closed, the pedler noticed
that the woman more than half turned round, and did—he
was quite sure of it—she did cast a momentary
glance at the clock. And that look was voluntary.
It cost her effort—it betrayed curiosity—the pedler
didn’t quite despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his hopes were ere long again on the ebb. The
woman seemed to have no disposition to return; at
least she didn’t make her appearance; and with a
good deal of reason the pedler thought that she did not
intend to return. Whether this was her resolution I
cannot say—quite probably she supposed that he had
departed. Be this, however, as it may, the pedler was
giving up, and had actually risen, and was in progress
toward the clock, with a view to deport it once more
to his wagon, when the door creaked, and the woman
again entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed inclined to pause—and, perhaps, did
pause—but, what was more to the pedler’s purpose,
he fancied that she was about to hazard some remark—he
hoped a commendation of the clock—at least a
word as to its good appearance. But he mistook.
She did, indeed, speak—a word or two only, however;
but for the life of him, the pedler couldn’t decide
whether the drift was for or against him. “I wish
Mr. M. was at home,” said the woman, “he—” she
paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was she going to add? The pedler would
have given almost the price of a clock to have had his
doubts resolved. “<span class='it'>He</span>”—did she mean that her husband
could decide for himself? So the pedler wished
to believe, while his better opinion, judging from her
manner, was, that she meant to intimate that her husband
would be even more summary—more indifferent
he could not appear—more set and determined was
impossible. But putting the construction upon her
words most favorable to his present interests, he ventured
to supply what she had failed to say, “Yes,
indeed,” said he, “if Mr. M. were at home, I dare
say he wouldn’t lose such a bargain as I would give
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bargain!</span>” the pedler had unconsciously used a
word of talismanic power the world over. “Bargain!”
that word seemed to arrest the woman’s attention—and
for the first time she raised her eyes and fairly
looked at the clock. And so it happened, that, at
this critical moment in the history of that clock, and
in the proceedings of the pedler in relation to a sale
of it, it struck one, two, three, up to eleven. Its tones
were soft, musical, attractive. It ceased—and for a
moment there was silence, but it was soon interrupted
by the woman’s adding, “It certainly strikes prettily!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ecstasy of the pedler was near being betrayed;
but it was for his interest to conceal his pleasure, and
so rising, he moved toward the clock, saying, “Its
striking <span class='it'>is</span> good—better, I think myself, than is common;”
at the same time opening the door and pulling
the striking wire, upon which its musical tones filled
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does sound well,” said the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” whispered the pedler to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Havn’t there recently been some improvements
in clock-making?” asked the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better and better,” thought the pedler—“Madam,”
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
said he, rousing from his transient reverie, and responding
to her question, “you asked me about improvements?
O yes, divers improvements—clocks
are made now-a-days in great perfection, and very
cheap—but—I was about making a proposition in reference
to that clock—” but he was cut short in the
very sentence⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can save you all trouble of that sort,” said the
woman, “I may take none of your clocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There again,” thought the pedler, “all aback!”
and now, how to retrieve lost ground, he was quite at
a loss. But a second thought came to his aid. The
language of the woman was peculiar—“I <span class='it'>may</span> take
none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam!” the pedler resumed, and with some little
more assurance, “I was going to put this clock to you
on such terms as that <span class='it'>you</span> may, or any other woman in
the wide world might take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman listened. She raised her hand to her
forehead—she hesitated—she seemed inclined to ask
a question, and at length she did inquire⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you sell your clocks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the pedler ventured to raise his eyes, they
would have resembled stars of the first magnitude;
but he was too politic to betray his sense of the vantage
he was gaining, and therefore rather coolly remarked,
“You seem so reluctant, madam, to purchase a clock,
that I’m at a loss how to reply. But if you will take
one, I’ll put it pretty much at your own price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will?” said she, her countenance relaxing into
a sort of smile, mingled with a spice of incredulity.
“That’s not a common way with you pedlers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O no,” said he, “we live by our trade, and must
make a trifle at least now and then; but we must sell,
if we don’t make much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the pedler was thus remarking, the woman
had approached near the clock, and for the purpose, it
would seem, of examining it—the pedler hoped with
reference to a purchase. And by way of helping on
this decision, he opened the clock—displayed its machinery—and
cautiously recommended it, by saying,
“it’s a handsome piece of furniture, you see—useful—and,
with your leave, it occupies just the place for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks well,” rejoined the woman, “but—” she
paused, “I—” she <a id='began'></a>began, and again stopped. At
length, however, she added, “I may not purchase it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had laid a more than ordinary emphasis, perhaps
unconsciously, on the word <span class='it'>purchase</span>. “What!”
thought the pedler, “does she expect me to <span class='it'>give</span> her a
clock?” No, he could not give the clock. That would
deprive him of an anticipated and now much desired
triumph. But matters now stood in such a position as
to demand prompt and decisive action. The pedler,
therefore, met the emergency like a tactician. “Madam,”
said he, “I ask no money for the clock. I am
willing to take such articles in payment as you have to
spare, and at your own price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman fairly stared. The matter wore a new
phase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean just as I say, madam,” said the pedler, observing
her apparent surprise. “Just what you have
to spare, and at your own price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what do you ask for the clock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen dollars—the small sum of fifteen dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman took a seat. For a few minutes she
seemed to be abstracted and lost. But at length returning
to the subject, she said, “On the terms you
propose, I will take the clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the decision which the pedler had been
looking for with all imaginable desire, and now no
time was to be lost—and none, indeed, was lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow me,” said the woman, rising and leading
the way to an outer room, where was standing a cask
with about a bushel of flaxseed, which she said had
been there time out of mind. Her husband had often
wished it away, and now the pedler might take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said the pedler, “and at what price?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three dollars,” replied the woman—it was double
the price of clean fresh seed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” said the pedler, his mind running over
the loss he must sustain on this basis; but loss or no
loss, he was glad to sell a clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What next, madam?” inquired the pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the woman, beginning fairly to exult
at the good bargain she was making, and even luxuriating
in the thought, as how her husband would himself
be pleased at her skill in bargain-making, “we’ve
got a calf you may take.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?” asked the pedler, a cold shudder following
hard on the annunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A calf, sir,” repeated the woman, “you said you
would take any thing we had to spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, right,” said the pedler, recovering himself
as well as he could, “a calf—O yes, all the same, that
is, nothing amiss by way of trade in this world; turn it
to account, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the woman had conducted our hero to
a small pen, with a southern exposure, adjoining the
barn, and there lay a—skeleton!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the calf,” said the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedler started back involuntarily; he bit his
lips, and for a moment was on the point of demurring.
What on earth was such a sickly-looking creature
worth? What could he do with it? How could he
carry it? These, and half a score of kindred questions
flitted across his mind. The pedler was perplexed;
he was out-generaled; but re-installing his waning
confidence with the thought, that as a dernier resort
he could deposit the sorry-looking brute under some
hedge by the wayside, like a veteran soldier in the
“battles of life,” he marched up to the emergency, and
with commendable good humor, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes—a calf, truly—but is it alive?” at the
same time half spurning it with his foot. “Yes, and
alive ’tis, surely. I thought it was dead; here, you
young ox, rouse up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The calf yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it does breathe, upon my soul,” said the
pedler; “yonder old cart can’t yawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed,” said the woman, her countenance relaxing
into a veritable smile, “indeed, I thought myself,
at the instant, that the creature was dead. It has been
ailing for more than a week, and my husband said only
yesterday, that he believed it would die; and he didn’t
much care how soon it did die. It looks a little better,
I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
Better! the pedler could have cracked a marble.
But there was no escaping from his dilemma. So with
as good a grace as was possible, he inquired, “What
price do you put upon the calf?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only ten dollars,” replied the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedler started. “Ten dollars!” he fairly exclaimed
with surprise. “Ten dollars! who ever heard
of such a price for a calf just gasping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are committed,” dryly observed the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see I am—committed—out-generaled, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it fair?” asked the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair!” repealed the pedler, “fair as the day itself;
right—all right; ten dollars—never mind, turn it to account,
I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This half-way controversy about the calf was thus
summarily settled, and a few other matters added, the
clock was paid for. But the pedler did not feel to
boast, as they say. He was vanquished, and yet the
victor. He had made a <span class='it'>bona fide</span> sale of a clock where
all hitherto had failed; and though for the present he
couldn’t show the shiners for his bargain, he hoped
in some way to bring up arrearages, and return to tell
a fair story to his compeers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood freshened his cheeks a good deal more than
usual, it must be confessed, as he helped the helpless
“young ox” to mount. It was quite a lug, as they say;
and, to tell the truth, he was right glad when his wagon,
with its added contents of dying stock, and dead stock,
was fairly outside of the yard in the public highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On emerging from the premises of farmer M. he
turned south toward V——n Court House, situated
some few miles distant. He had now time to lay his
plans. In the interval there were few dwellings, and
even if there had been, he was in no mood for any
new adventure just in that region. As we have already
intimated, however, the pedler was a man of large experience;
and more than this, he had profited by it—he
had acquired tact—he was well fitted to extricate
himself from difficulty, and that of the most perplexing
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From an occasional inquiry of a passing traveler, he
ascertained that the court was in session at V——n
Court House; and his plan of operations was predicated
upon this welcome intelligence. He thought
that if it proved so, he might make a demonstration to
some profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the ample green, on which the Court
House stood, he was satisfied that the court was
in session. Accordingly, he drew up at some little
distance from the front door, unhitched his horses, and
made ready. Shortly after, the court adjourned. The
throng, in goodly numbers, issued from the building;
and it so happened that they were in great good humor—a
cause having just been decided the right way to
please the populace; and of this sort of people there
was an abundance, with a commendable sprinkling of
a somewhat higher grade. At this critical moment
the pedler stepped upon his cart, and in quite a civil
way, begged to announce to the gentlemen, that he had
some few articles on sale, which he would be happy
to show them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd gathered round, and the inquiry rose
thicker and faster, “What you got?” “What you got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Responding to the already clamorous demand, the
pedler, with a calm and composed front, said that
if the gentlemen pleased, he would take the liberty to
exhibit a specimen of <span class='it'>flaxseed</span>. He had paid a large
price for it, and not having a great quantity, he would
sell only a spoonful of it to an individual. In this way
he could give them all a chance; but mark it, gentlemen,
if you please, said he, “I sell only one spoonful
to an individual; one spoonful—not a thimbleful
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Price?” inquired a farmer, who thought much of
choice seeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One dollar, gentlemen, per spoonful,” said the
pedler. “I know it’s high—but <span class='it'>such</span> flaxseed, gentlemen,
you don’t see every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dollar for a spoonful of flaxseed!” exclaimed a
man—one of the old settlers, with a long pendent queue
to his back—“I have been a long time in these parts,
but I never heard such a price for a spoonful of flaxseed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fair price, I dare say,” said a man standing by,
“a fair price, if it’s the genuine—the genuine—there,
now, I can’t think of the kind—it’s the new sort. I’d
give five dollars, if I couldn’t get a spoonful without.
Only for seed, sir—for seed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, Mr. Pedler,” said another, “is this seed imported?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why I rather think it was. I <span class='it'>im</span>ported it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what country did it come?” asked another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s more than I can say, whether from
Flanders, or Ireland, or New Holland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these names were enough; and as the last
seemed to linger longest on some one’s mind, he immediately
exclaimed, “New Holland! yes, I dare say—a
grand country for flax,” and presently the multitude
had improved upon these hints—in part facts, and in
part surmises—and round it went, that there was flaxseed
of a choice kind, just in from New Holland; and
one man, who seemed to know something of geography,
and whose logic was about equal to what he
knew of the face of the earth, declared that as it had
come some thousands of miles, it was, <span class='it'>therefore</span>, probably
a very long or tall kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen!” said the pedler, who had watched
the increasing enthusiasm with the most solid satisfaction,
and who thought it quite time to make a strike,
“gentlemen, one dollar per spoonful for this flaxseed—your
only chance, don’t expect ever to offer flaxseed
here again; last chance, gentlemen—who’ll⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was cut short by the advance of a clever, and
even staid looking man, who said, “I’ll take a
spoonful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I”—“and I”—“and I,” said half a dozen
voices all together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One at a time, gentlemen,” said the pedler, “serve
you all, and just as fast as I can—the sooner I get
through the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he went on, parceling out the flaxseed, and
pocketing the dollars, till at last he had the pleasure—and
a profound pleasure it was—to stow away in his
money-wallet the 75th dollar for the 75th spoonful of
flaxseed taken from an old cask in the out-room of Mr.
M., in the “Old Dominion,” in part pay for a clock,
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
but which some of the purchasers would have it had
come direct from New Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventy-five dollars for the flaxseed,” said the
pedler, “seventy-five dollars—seventy-five—that will
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the pedler’s voice was again heard, and on
a somewhat higher key. “Gentlemen,” said he,
“I’ve a still more remarkable article to dispose of—only
one, and only one can have it; and the question
is, who will be the fortunate purchaser. Gentle—men,
this <span class='it'>calf</span> is for sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The welkin rung. “A calf for sale!” said half a
dozen. “Come, walk up—who’ll buy? Who wants
a calf?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better sell yourself,” said a roughish-looking
stripling, addressing the pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite likely, my man,” responded the pedler. “I
lately felt a good deal more like a calf than I do just
now. But I’ll sell the calf first, and then think about
selling myself. This calf for sale. Who bids?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Price?” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-five dollars,” replied the pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What breed?” asked another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you all see, as for that matter, that he’s
<span class='it'>short horns</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very plain matter of fact, that,” said a good-natured,
jolly sort of a fellow. “Is he Durham, or what
is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s more than I know—he’s <span class='it'>short horns</span>, but
whether Durham or Dedham—how can I tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Durham!” exclaimed a prompt, rosy-cheeked
fellow, stepping up; “why, you simpleton, don’t you
know the value of the creature you are selling—even
a bigger simpleton might see with half an eye that he’s
Durham; look at his white spots—he’s handsome
as a picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handsome!” retorted another, “I wonder where
you see beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said another, “never mind for beauty—what’s
his name, Mr. Pedler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the pedler, “I don’t know exactly
what to call him. I guess we’ll call him Dromeo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Romeo, you fool,” said a voice in the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, what a mistake—funny enough,” said
the pedler. “Romeo, gentlemen, Romeo—who’ll
bid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, as in case of the flaxseed, the praises of
Romeo went the rounds, till there was even a controversy
who should have him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suffice it to say, a square-built man was the purchaser.
The money was paid, even before Romeo
was let down on to terra firma. But that operation
was now gone through with, and the first result was
that the calf fell like a flounder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, aint you ashamed of yourself, Romeo,” said
the pedler; “come, stand up in the presence of these
gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Romeo, however, couldn’t find his legs, as they say;
and the pedler had to explain and apologize for his
want of manners. “He had been a little ailing,” he
believed, “but the person of whom <a id='ofwhom'></a>I purchased him,
said he looked better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No wonder if he does ail a little,” said a man who
was helping him to stand up, “it’s a long voyage he’s
come, and cattles are quite likely to get sick on a
voyage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, indeed,” said another, “he looks like as if
he’d been very sea-sick—I dare say he was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He needs something to eat,” said the pedler, “it’s
a good while that he’s been fasting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the purchaser, with some assurance,
and well satisfied with his bargain, “plenty of milk
hard by—come, boys, give him a lift into the wagon,
and I’ll import him a little further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, some half a dozen hands were soon
occupied in raising Romeo into the farmer’s wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the pedler rolled up the bills, and safely
deposited them in his pocket-book, which, on returning
to its usual place, he said, “One hundred dollars!
one hundred dollars for a clock!—a clock sold to Mr.
M., of ——! One hundred dollars—that will do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No time was now lost by the pedler in re-hitching
his horses, which done, he left for head-quarters, there
to tell and exult over the success of his experiment in
selling a clock. The multitude, which had been some
time thinning, now left the Court House and its <a id='pre'></a>precincts
to their solitude.</p>

<hr class='tbk127'/>

<p class='pindent'>Our story summons us once more, but briefly, to the
farm-house of Mr. M.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about half past seven that same evening, the
farmer having returned, was quietly seated with his
wife at the supper-table. He seemed, though wearied,
in excellent spirits. Several circumstances had occurred
during the day to put him in good humor. And
for some reason his wife looked, he thought, more
than ordinarily interesting; she was dressed with
more taste. The room was neat and tidy; the light
shone more brilliantly, and the table had a better bill
of fare; in short, Mrs. M. had exerted herself to give
her husband as kind and welcome a reception as she
well could. And she had evidently succeeded. He
seemed pleased, while she herself was unusually
cheerful and sociable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had just turned out a third or fourth cup of tea
for Mr. M., and was in the very act of handing it to
him across the table, when from an adjoining room
was heard the clock striking one, two, three, four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. M. had taken the cup, but it fell as suddenly as
if at that instant a paralysis had seized his arm—the
cup broke, and the tea flooded the table; at the same
time the glance of a kindled eye shot across at his
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caroline!” said he, in a sharp and inquisitive tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Husband!” at the same time exclaimed Mrs. M.
“My dear husband, will you hear me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the exasperated man, “hear what?
What is the meaning of all this? No, I don’t want to
hear any explanation. You have violated⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear husband,” interrupted Mrs. M., “only
hear me—one instant—one brief explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” said he, rising from his chair. At the
same time his wife rose, and approaching him, gently
laid her hand upon his shoulder, and supplicated his
calm and kind attention to her explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you purchased that clock?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
“Husband! may be I’ve done wrong,” she replied,
“but how can you judge till you hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. M. was a man of impulse, as the reader will
readily perceive—and yet he was kind in his nature;
and when reason was permitted to speak, he was disposed
to listen and judge with candor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his wife’s request he resumed his seat. She drew
her chair to his side. She explained. First she spoke
of the calf, and of the ten dollars allowed her for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You recollect, husband,” said she, “that only
yesterday you wished it dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that, indeed,” said Mr. M., his choler beginning
again to wax hot, “but I had rather lost twenty
calves than patronize one of those detestable pedlers.
You knew my wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, my husband; and but for the opportunity of
getting rid of articles absolutely valueless to us, I should
never have presumed to have made such a purchase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let that pass,” said the husband, his own
good sense confessing that she got a large price for
what he had wished off his premises—only he didn’t
wish to be thought patronizing a pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got a large price,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied Mrs. M., “the clock-man,” she
avoided the mention of the word pedler, “allowed me
to name my own price, and I aimed in the whole to
please you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To please me!” said Mr. M., <a id='petu'></a>petulantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to excite your displeasure rather, I should
have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and what next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You place me in trying circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You placed yourself there,” interrupted her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, according to your view of the case,” said
Mrs M., “and you make me regret that I could suffer
myself to be tempted to take a clock; but I see no way
but to proceed and tell you the whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said Mr. M.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, husband, you recollect that cask of
old flaxseed out in⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flaxseed!” he exclaimed, his voice absolutely
sounding over the whole house, at the same time the
blood rushing to his face, “flaxseed!—did you sell that
flaxseed? Is it, then, possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray,” said Mrs. M., “what is the meaning of
your unwonted excitement? What have I done to
raise this awful storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done?” said he, “done? That flaxseed!—was it,
then, that?” he paused. “And pray what did you get
for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was nearly a bushel of it,” replied Mrs. M.,
“and I was allowed three dollars for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three dollars a bushel!” he exclaimed. “Yes,
it must be that—it must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole truth was now before him. He understood
the length and breadth of the matter. His wife
was the dupe of a keen and practiced pedler; but she
was less a dupe than himself. Slowly putting his
hand into his pocket, he took thence a paper, which
he handed to his wife, and bid her open it. She did
so; and in it was a spoonful of what was once <span class='it'>flaxseed</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge her surprise!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Husband!” said she, “what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean?” said he, “why it means that I am more
of a fool than yourself. You sold a bushel of flaxseed
for three dollars, and I paid one dollar for a spoonful
of it. That is what it means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?” asked Mrs. M.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story was soon told. He was one of the seventy-five
who had that day purchased the flaxseed. He had
left the ground before the selling was through, and
hence was ignorant as to the fate of the calf. But
now the whole was unraveled. And while husband
and wife both experienced some mortification of feeling,
the joke was too good to allow any protracted
disturbance of their composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. M. procured another cup, as her husband declared
that the matter of the clock shouldn’t deprive
him of his usual allowance of tea, especially after a
day of such fatigue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meal was at length finished; but before that,
both had recovered their equanimity, and even smiled
at the strange events of the day. The pedler didn’t
escape some little malediction for the part he had
acted; but Mr. M. declared that a man deserved some
credit who could carry his purposes despite of such
obstacles; but after all, he thought his wife the better
salesman, who could dispose of a bushel of old flaxseed
for three dollars, and a calf as good as dead for
ten dollars.</p>

Heart of Mid-Lothian” stands conspicuous, and perhaps
maintains a higher degree of popularity than any other
of the numerous productions of his pen. Of course,
every reader is familiar with the narrative, and we
think all will be gratified by an examination of the
beautiful picture of the unfortunate <span class='sc'>Effie Deans</span>,
which graces the present number of our Magazine.
It is from the burin of Mr. <span class='sc'>T. B. Welch</span>, and is executed
in the most finished style of that very superior
engraver. The point of time chosen by the artist for
the delineation of his subject, is that at which the procurator
Sharpitlaw causes himself to be conveyed to
the cell of the miserable girl, for the purpose of eliciting
information respecting the haunts of Robertson.
The great novelist tells us that “the poor girl was
seated on her little flock-bed, plunged in a deep reverie.
Some food stood on the table, of a quality better than
is usually supplied to prisoners, but it was untouched.
The person under whose care she was more particularly
placed said, ‘that sometimes she tasted naething
from the tae end of the four and twenty hours to the
t’other, except a drink of water.’ ”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE WHOOPING CRANE. (<span class='it'>Ardea Americana.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Flocks of this bird are found during the autumn
season in the Middle and Western States, and along
the shores of the great lakes. In summer they resort
in countless numbers to their breeding places, in the
high northern latitudes, from which they are again
driven at the return of the arctic winters. These migrations
are regular, and extend from the vast plains of
South America to the snows of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While performing these immense journeys, the Cranes
pass at such a height in the air as to be invisible, stopping
occasionally at some favorite resting place in the
line of their route. They are frequently seen at those
periods in the marshes and rice plantations of the
South, and in much smaller numbers near Cape May,
where they are known by the name of Storks. At
those times they attract much attention, principally of
course from sportsmen; and a small number remain
at the Cape all winter. Here they wander in the mud,
searching for worms; or if on the wing they keep
near the shore, sailing from place to place with a low,
heavy flight, and uttering a loud piercing cry, which
may be heard two miles. From this scream, and its
occasional modulations, the bird has received its name.
If wounded, the Whooping Crane boldly faces his
pursuers, attacks dog or man, and has been known by
one stroke to drive his bill through the gunner’s hand.
It is, however, a difficult bird to shoot, on account of
its shyness and vigilance. When a flock rises from
the ground it ascends spirally to a great height, each
member sending forth the piercing scream, which,
uniting with the others, and ringing through the air,
fills the beholder with a feeling approaching to terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The favorite localities of the Whooping Crane are
impenetrable swamps, salt marshes, and small ponds
or lakes near the sea. Here it hunts its prey, passes
its social life, feeds and nourishes its young. Their
nests are made of long grass, raised more than a foot
above the ground, and usually hidden among unfrequented
swamps. The eggs are two in number, of a
pale blue color, spotted with brown. Thousands are
reared every summer at these favorite haunts, the
young setting out in the following season with the
others, for the more genial climate of the South. This
bird is frequently eaten, and is said to be palatable.
Its common food is worms, insects, mice, moles, etc.
It is the tallest bird indigenous to the United States,
measuring four feet six inches in length, and when
erect five feet in height. The bill is truly formidable,
being six inches long, an inch and a half thick, straight
and extremely sharp. The general color, excepting
that of the head and the primaries, is pure white, many
of the feathers on each side lengthening into graceful
plumes, like those of the ostrich. The legs and thighs
are black, thick and strong. The tail, in common
with that of the species, is covered by a broad flag of
plumage, which sets off the gracefulness of this truly
graceful bird to full advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is supposed on good authority that the species
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
known by naturalists as the Brown Crane is but the
young of this bird. It appears to extend also across
Behring’s Straits and throughout the great part of
northern Asia. It has likewise been confounded with
the Canadian Crane, whose habits are thus described
by Major Long: “They fly at a great height, and
wheeling in circles, appear to rest, without effort, on
the surface of an aerial current, by whose eddies they
are borne about in an endless series of revolutions.
Each individual describes a large circle in the air, independently
of his associates, and uttering loud, distinct,
and repeated cries. They continue thus to wing
their flight upward, gradually receding from the earth
until they become mere specks upon the sight, and
finally altogether disappear, leaving only the discordant
music of their concert to fall faintly on the ear, exploring</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CEDAR BIRD. (<span class='it'>Ampelis Americana.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is also known by the names of the Crown
Bird, and the Cherry Bird. It abounds in the United
States, and is found as far south as Mexico, and northward
to Canada. During the Summer months flocks
of Cedar birds are found in the mountainous tracts of
our country, where they find abundant food in the
whortleberries with which, at that season, the Blue
Mountains, the Alleghanies, and the Cumberland
abound. At the approach of autumn they leave these
haunts, and descend to more cultivated, to feed upon
the berries of the sour gum and red cedar. The latter
is their favorite food; a small flock is not unfrequently
seen on one small cedar tree; and here they
gorge themselves to such an extent that they may
easily be taken by the hand. This voracity does not
leave the bird even in captivity; for instances have
been known of a tame or wounded one gormandizing
upon apples or berries, until it choked to death. They
are also fond of grapes, ripe persimmons, and almost
every kind of berry; but the pursuit of insects, which
they sometimes indulge in, appears to originate rather
from a love of sport, or of mischief, than from any
preference to that kind of food. During the season of
fruit they are fat, tender, and much esteemed for the
table; but they become almost worthless when obliged
to live upon insects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cedar Bird is noted for its graceful figure, the
beauty of its plumage, and for the tuft or crown which
adorns the head, and which it can elevate or depress
at pleasure. The feathers are of the texture of fine
silk or down, glossy and beautiful. It has long been
confounded by foreigners with the European Chatterer,
but is much smaller than that bird, possesses
marked differences of plumage, and specific differences
of nature. Its usual note is but a feeble lisp, generally
uttered while rising or alighting. When flying they
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
move in parties of fifty or sixty, crowded closely together,
and on reaching a tree alight in the same compact
manner. Of course the sportsman is enabled to
do terrible execution, sometimes destroying half a
flock at a single discharge. Their great enemy is the
farmer; and when we take into consideration how
perseveringly they endeavor to harvest his cherry
orchards, even to the last gleaning, in spite, too, of
guns and scare-crows, it must be acknowledged that
he has better cause for war against them than in many
instances of supposed feathered aggressions. The
Cedar Bird, however, increases rapidly; and a singular
circumstance connected with its habits is the unusually
late time at which it begins to build. This is
supposed to be owing to a scarcity of food in the spring.
The nest is not begun before the second week in June.
It is located on a cedar tree, or in some orchard, usually
in a forked branch ten or twelve feet from the
ground. The bottom is composed of coarse dry stalks
of grass, and the whole is lined with very fine threads
or blades of the same material. The eggs are three or
four in number, white, with a bluish cast, very sharp
at the point, and blunt at the other end, the whole surface
marked with small round black spots. After being
hatched the young are fed for a while on insects,
and afterward on berries. If the nest be attacked the
parent birds utter no cry, but will sometimes make a
show of defence by snapping the bill, elevating the
crest, and attack with mimick fury the object which
disturbs them.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY JOSEPH R. CHANDLER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a general rule, we must look to the earliest years
of a man to ascertain the facts and circumstances which
have influenced the conduct and produced the result of
his latest years; just as we ascend to the sources of a
stream, to find what has caused the color and quality of
its water; on looking a little down we find those assisting
or disturbing accidents that divert or direct its current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while the quality of a man’s mind may be dependent
upon the gifts of God or the culture of his infancy—while
we may trace up from the last effort of matured
greatness to the earliest movement of the nascent powers,
the influence of the first directing causes, and see how
qualities were improved and greatness achieved; while
all the colors of the mind seem to be derived from infancy,
and the fame of the youth is made obviously referable to
the culture of the nursery and the fireside circle, we cannot
shut our eyes to the fact that even in later years,
when the tone or the color of the mind becomes fixed,
when the qualities have insured fame and eminence,
some unseen, and by the world unsuspected, cause operates
to disturb the onward course, impede the progress,
lessen the influence, and thus diminish the greatness of
the gifted one that has been “the observed of all observers,”
as a projecting rock divides the current at the
mouth of a stream, or an accumulated bar prevents a depth
and destroys the usefulness of a river which has flowed
steadily, beautifully and profitably from its source in the
mountain to its entrance into the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, not to drop the simile, we see some men moving
on in constantly augmenting consequence, swaying public
opinion and enlightening public sentiment, and seeming
to bid fair to swallow up in their fame the credit of
all, by making all tributary to them, when suddenly they
sink from observation; drop from the course they have
pursued, and are lost to sight, just as the rivers of Florida
flow along with augmented volume toward the Gulf, as
if to gather themselves into a glorious estuary, when suddenly
they sink into the earth, and are lost amid the subterranean
caverns that abound in a country of such peculiar
geological formation, and like</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We see around us numerous instances of this kind of
autumnal failure. History is full of them. Our country
presents cases of remarkable strength. And as it acquires
years and augmented numbers, more will present themselves,
and as the means of observation increase, and publicity
becomes greater, of course attention will be more
drawn to the fact; and perhaps the causes, too, will be
better understood, I do not know that they will be
avoided; if we are right in our conjectures as to their
causes, then we fear that they will continue—and while
they continue they will produce like effects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am about to speak of the disturbing cause of manhood—the
hidden influences to harm to which he is exposed—something
that comes in manhood to defeat the hopes and
expectation of childhood and youth, something that paralyzes
the arm lifted in the harvest field, for which seed-time
had been appropriately used, and vernal showers and
summer suns had done their work of good. I must not,
however, be supposed to intimate that all attention is not
due to infancy and childhood, to insure the man of worth,
or that all of goodness and most of greatness in age are
not the consequence of early devotion. We know it is—but
we are not hence released from the necessity of inquiry,
what it is that defeats the labors given to age—what
is it that strikes down the man in his upward march—what
is it that suddenly, to the appearance of the world,
but perhaps slowly to the sufferer, withdraws the vital
stamina of his mind, and leaves him powerless, hopeless,
<span class='it'>ambitionless</span>! The tree that sheds its deciduous leaves in
autumn, may have in itself no powers to renew its foliage
in the spring, and if sentient would feel that the sap
which was receding from its branches would never again
flow, to promote its growth and restore its beauty—but
the world would know nothing of the blight until spring
had brought out other trees, and exposed its nakedness
and death, then it might concern the arborator to inquire
what had affected that “which promised ere long
to be the pride of the wood and prince among the neighboring
trees.” Is man less worthy of consideration than
insensible wood? But man does not regard his kind; he
acknowledges a law for all of nature beside, but for himself
and his, he submits all to chance, and fate becomes
the providence of submission. If with the season a single
class of birds omit their advent—or come in less considerable
numbers than was their wont—forthwith the philosopher
peers into nature, compares her laws, and with infinite
research comes to guess at the motive which influenced
the motion of the feathered tribe. “But man dieth
and wasteth away.” The immortality upon which he is
seizing fades in his grasp, or his hand becomes palsied—few
or none reach the point at which they aim, and there
is no one to ask the reason of the failure, or to explain the
causes which have disappointed the aspirant of his fame
and the world of its advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of how much more value are ye than many sparrows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have often in moments of reflection upon the fame and
conduct of particular, distinguished men, felt a great
anxiety to know something of their private life, that I
might be able to judge of the cause of the disappointment
which their life’s close had worked for their friends and
admirers. I have put the question to some one who might
have more knowledge than I of the individual to whom I
referred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he drinks too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true—anybody can see that. But how does it
happen that such a person should drink too much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The constant demand upon his intellect gave him a
habit of stimulating, and that is a good way toward intoxication.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do not see in his pursuits that kind of demand
for stimuli which poets are supposed to have? I think
that drinking is rather an effect than a cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such questions and such answers, with such conclusions,
were frequent. Accident at length led me to a
closer knowledge of the circumstances of one person,
whose fame seemed to pale before the effectual fires of
some hidden conflagration.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
Blackstone had taken his place at the bar of his native
county, and extended his practice to the various courts of
the State, so that he seemed, in a few years, to have got
possession of a position for which many had given a life
time of labor. The amount of his business at the bar did
not hinder him from distinguishing himself in the halls of
the legislature, and his commanding eloquence commended
him to the people of both parties as a representative in
Congress, where his career fulfilled all the expectations of
his warmest political friends, and justified the vote in his
favor of his political opponents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years passed away, and the habits of this popular and
eminent citizen were less exemplary than the fame of his
talents would require, and while his many friends had to
confess a bitter disappointment, he seemed dissatisfied
with himself, and constantly in need of something which
no one seemed able to impart. He lost the high position
which he had reached, and the world wondered at the
change; all, of course, censured the recusant, and blamed
him justly, because there was that in his habits which
shocked the temperate. “No man in these days,” it was
said with emphasis, “no man can expect to sustain himself
in any public position who neglects the proprieties of
life by indulging in intemperate use of spirituous liquor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was a cause for the lapse in the upward course.
To drink too much is to be unable to ascend—we do not
mean a play upon a vulgar designation for inebriety, when
we say that he who drinks too much has in him a too heavy
load to take with him to the temple of desirable fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But admitting intemperance as the proximate cause of
the change in the man’s conduct—may we not be allowed
to suspect that there was a remote cause—some less potent
influence working the evil, but producing through the
agency of liquor? In other words we did inquire into the
circumstances of Blackstone and found that there was a
remote cause, and we found also what that cause was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackstone’s fine person and commanding talents, gave
him the welcome <span class='it'>entrée</span> of the first families of West Virginia:
whether these are equal to the real F. F. V. of the
eastern portion of the State, we do not know, but they were
glad to find Blackstone among them. He married a young
woman of good education—we mean of considerable school
learning—and she was beside handsome and agreeable.
She admired the position which Blackstone had achieved—was
pleased with the fame of her husband, and not a little
elated at the distinction which his character and popularity
conferred on her. The world all saw that Mrs. B.
was proud of her husband—the world as usual made a
mistake. She was proud of being Blackstone’s wife. The
reflected honor was most grateful, and she enjoyed it.
She appreciated the distinction which she possessed,
almost as highly as she did the abundant <a id='sup'></a>supply of money
which her husband’s position at the bar enabled him to
supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Blackstone never thought much about the manner
in which the money was acquired, and never for a
moment thought of the ingredients of her husband’s fame.
She knew that Mr. B. was a distinguished lawyer, but it
never occurred to her that the maintenance of his position
demanded as much exertion as did the attainment thereof.
She knew by common fame, by the newspapers, and by
other tokens, that her husband was one of the most distinguished
speakers of that speaking portion of the country,
and she knew, because all said, that his speeches in
the halls of legislation or at the courts of justice were not
merely verbal outpourings, they contained deep thought
and persuasive arguments, and constant instruction. But
it never occurred to Mrs. B. that these gigantic works of
her husband were the result of efforts; that without due
preparation he would have failed in the midst of his argument,
and that each glorious exposition of the law to the
court, each elucidation of the constitution to the Legislature
demanded that its successor should be as well sustained,
should add to his fame for learning and acumen,
and that consequently new study, new labor, new intensity
of application, could alone secure to the gifted speaker
the fame which his antecedent argument had acquired.
To her, we say, such an idea never occurred. She seemed
to think, or at least her conduct would warrant the conclusion
that she thought, the eloquence and the learning
of her husband were as little the result of exertions as was
his physical proportion, and that one of his great speeches
was as easily made as was a pedestrian movement from
his house to the office. The truth is, she thought nothing
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A friend whose business calls him frequently to the
West, tells us that he was at one time an inmate of Mr.
Blackstone’s family for some weeks—that on one occasion
the whole town had been wrapt in admiration at one of
his magnificent addresses in the court-house—it was a
speech which if it had been the only one of any man’s life
would have insured enviable fame. Our informant,
roused from the deep absorption which the speech produced,
hastened at its close to the dwelling of Mr. B., that
he might sit and enjoy the rich effect which the language
and tone had produced upon his mind. Mrs. B. was in the
parlor, and he informed her of the unexampled efforts and
success of her husband. She merely remarked that she
had heard him speak often before their marriage but never
since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, a lady was not going to laud her husband;
she was modest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the evening, the visiter was sitting in the library,
when Mr. B. entered that portion of the house. He
was exhausted, mentally and physically. He knew that he
had done great things, and he desired, as all men do, to
have his wife share in the pleasure—nay, to double the
pleasure to him by her kind, affectionate, partial commendation
of his labors, and hearty rejoicings at his success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was, Cornelia,” said he, “one of my most fortunate
hits, and when I summed up the testimony and presented
the cause of the injured widow, there was not a dry eye in
the court-room; and the gallery was crowded with ladies.
Mrs. Campbell sat in front, listening with the most
marked attention—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she—what dress did Mrs. Campbell wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dress—but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was ever thus. Whatever effort Blackstone made—whatever
applause abroad followed his exertions, there
was an entire want of sympathy at home. Not that Mrs.
B. was without high mental powers, not that those powers
lacked cultivation; but she had no knowledge of what a
public man expects of his home, no comprehension of the
great fact, that no out-of-door applause, no huzza of the
multitude, no approval of even a judicious public is complete
in its effect upon the recipient, unless sanctioned
and sealed by the council at home—a council the head and
chief of which is the wife, but which includes every member
of the domestic circle. Distinguished men are not
candidates alone for <span class='it'>applause</span>. They receive the censure,
the vituperation, and persecution sometimes of those
whose views they may oppose. Whose good they can no
longer promote—for whom they have done the ninety-nine
good acts but failed in their attempt at the hundredth—and
that failure cancels all obligations for former success; how
prospective is public gratitude!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackstone of course had his opponents, and when he
entered his house, stung with insults from impeached motives,
and felt how faithless had been those upon whom he
had leaned, a word or two of kindness, one intimation that
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
he could and would survive all such attacks. One gentle,
soothing strain from a wife who knows or ought to know
the most sensitive spot on which the public thong had
fallen, and who can apply the soothing ointment of affection—one
cheering word would have lifted him over the
difficulty and made him feel that in himself he had the material
of resistance, and the weapons of final victory. A
glass or two of brandy stiffens the nerves and rallies the
mind to its wonted tone—that application must, of course,
be increased in amount whenever renewed, or the effect
will cease—and we need not tell what must be the consequence
of such a resort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remedy of wife-like sympathy, domestic soothing,
may indeed, like the latter, need augmentation by frequency
of application—but it comes from a source that is
never dried up by use, that increases by drafts upon it—and
produces no injurious effects upon the mind or body
made recipient of its soothing power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know now, because I know more than I have above
related, that the errors of Blackstone, his short-coming,
the comparative dimness of his once glowing fame which
seemed marked to “shine more and more unto the perfect
day;” his want of perseverance—his new habits of remissness—his
loss of fame—all, all are due to a want of
<span class='it'>home</span>—of that which makes his house his home—makes
home—home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I speak not here of the thousand instances in which incompatability
of temper forever precludes family enjoyment—where
vice, or what is next to vice, want of domestic
proprieties, disturb the peace of home; I cite no
instance of the defeat of a man’s high purpose, and the
baffling of the noble aims which elevated talents and finished
education may form—I quote not shipwrecks like
those which may be due to the vulgar mind or the vicious
course of the wife—such causes are usually as obvious as
their effects. The men of more spirit than judgment
breaks away from the destructive cause, and tries to acquire
an independence of home. Man is not independent
of home, if he has a place which he calls home, and all his
life, and all his conduct, and all his experience must and
will derive their coloring in no mean degree from that
home, however man may treat its condition or seek to
place himself beyond its influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distinguished Mr. Coke of South Carolina, seemed
to me in some considerable intercourse, to have rather a
brilliant fancy, but to lack that severe discipline which
goes to make a man truly and permanently great and popular—yet
he seldom failed in producing a considerable
effect on an audience which he addressed, whatever might
be the subject, and nervous as was his system—he rarely
evinced on the morning after a defeat any tokens of irritation
or discouragement. His wife made it her business,
and it became her pleasure to be an auditor of his narrations—to
hear his complaints against individuals at the
moment of anger and seem to forget his charges when returning
equanimity led him to speak in a different tone
and temper of his vigorous and sometimes successful antagonist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He never came from a public exercise of his talents
without being willingly compelled to give an account of
the whole matter to his family, unless it was unpleasant;
in that case his wife was the attentive soothing
listener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The triumph of the forum or the ‘stump’ (pardon the
Americanism,) was doubled in the joy which the narration
gave to the family, and the unpleasant occurrences of such
arenas were never referred to in the family, so that Coke
was sure of pleasure at home, whatever may have been
the pleasure abroad—he was sure of delicate sympathy at
home whatever may have been the vexation abroad. His
fireside was the seat of pleasure—his house was his home—his
home was a home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is the result of all this? The course of Mr. Coke
as all know has been onward and upward—not with the
swiftness or the sunlike aim of Blackstone—but steadily,
constantly, and successfully. Charge Mrs. Blackstone
with having impeded the course of her gifted husband, and
she would start with anger at, and abhorrence of the charge.
She had never disgraced him by misconduct, nor hindered
him by interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Credit Mrs. Coke with having been the cause of her
husband’s success, and she would be not less astonished;
she knew nothing of the subjects of which her husband
had acquired fame by speaking; she had consequently
never assisted in his preparation for public display, nor
added an idea to his brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold negative of Mrs. Blackstone had chilled her
husband into indifference or disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheering warmth of Mrs. Coke’s affectionate attention
and timely attendance had inspired her husband
with that proper degree of self-respect which is necessary
to self-dependence, and her soothing sympathies had lulled
unfriendly feelings toward others, so that he lost nothing
of acquired popularity by injudicious utterance of irritated
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not be difficult to adduce numerous instances,
in divers walks of life, of the good effect of matrimonial
sympathy upon the success of the husband and the position
of the family. Very little can be expected of a man
abroad who lives in a state of constant indifference at home—who
has there no encouragement to efforts, and no gentle
soothing in failure, no inspiriting by the utterance of confidence
in his powers, who gathers no gentle pride by those
hearty, warm, open plaudits at the fireside, which would
have shocked his feelings if offered abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant needs it, when his adventure is in imminent
danger, or his losses exceed his expectations. The
mechanic requires it when planning some work from
which a kind of fame and a hoped for credit are to flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laborer has as much advantage from the encouraging
tone of his wife’s voice as has any other man, and disappointment
has its sting poisoned or extracted, just as
the woman sees proper to meet the evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a man would be rich he must ask his wife.” This
is an old and a true proverb, and applies as much to the
riches of fame and station as to those of pecuniary estimate.
And if a man hopes to rise in life, let him as a
means of ascent carefully weigh the character of her who
is to be his companion—let him investigate closely her
habits of sympathizing with others, and her ability to conform
to his situation. Wealth, beauty, talents, education,
are all desirable in woman, all appropriate to her
position, all contribute to her means of true usefulness.
But coldness, selfishness, indifference to the tastes and
feelings of others, and consequent uselessness as a wife,
are all quite inconsistent with those other attractions,
and render them worthless—a means of annoyance rather
than a source of pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Constant affection, household knowledge, unfailing
sympathy with the wishes, views and efforts of the husband,
good common sense, are those jewels of a wife’s
inheritance which are infinitely above all others, though
eminently consistent with those usually so highly valued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let no female reader think the dignity or the rights of
her sex invaded, nor the wrongs neglected, and start up
to declare what a miserable state a bad husband imposes
upon a wife; we are speaking of an independent evil. We
know how much misery is brought into families, and how
all good is banished by the follies and wickedness of the
husband. But our business now is to speak of the errors
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
of the wife—faults of character which it seems almost impossible
to correct in the individual, but which must be
looked to and avoided by those who look to marriage as a
means of happiness and advancement. The person must
be avoided: faults of conduct are more or less easily corrected,
as they more or less depend upon the character,
condition, or temper of the individual. But, alas! when,
after repeated monitions, and as repeated failures, people
come to say “it is her way,” then it seems almost impossible
to hope for success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears to us, however, worth while for men, and
women too, to look at the circumstances to which we
profess only to have referred. Let them weigh the value
of domestic peace—let them estimate the worth of home
attractions and home pleasures, and let some one sit
down and look calmly and philosophically at the influence
of family peace, family pleasure, family support, upon the
character and condition of a man—of the husband—and
then see whether what <span class='it'>we</span> have noticed is not worth the
notice of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not say that the man of learning wants a learned
wife, nor that the statesman needs a political partner. But
both need a wife who will sympathize in their feelings,
will try to improve advantages and mitigate evils, and
thus to bring to the house and the fireside the great
sources of man’s happiness and man’s triumphs.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A Second Visit to the United States of North America. By
Sir Charles Lyell, F. R. S. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.
2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Lyell is the exact opposite of those English
tourists who emphasize the little peculiarities of American
character, and pass off their caricatures as national
traits. He is a rigid man of science, without sufficient
humor or imagination to seize upon individual peculiarities,
and confines himself altogether to facts and sensible
remarks. He is essentially a moderate man in mind as
well as in disposition, and thoroughly conscientious, good-natured
and unimpassioned. His eye for scenery is that
of a man of science, not of a poet; he observes geology
and botany, not mountains and sunny slopes of green hills;
and through the whole book there is not one example of
his mind rising above the dead level of calm observation
and classification, even in the presence of the most beautiful
and sublime scenes of nature. In regard equally to
men, institutions, and scenery, he seems incapable either
of admiration or dislike, and from his utter lack of sensitiveness
to any impressions, the reader is made to wonder
how he can be any thing but a bore to himself. His moderation
is perfect. He discusses the copyright question
and the question of slavery in a manner so cool and just
as to distinguish him from all other English tourists, and
also from all American chatterers on those word-flooded
themes. If he is thus destitute of glow and enthusiasm,
it must be admitted that these defects have their compensations.
His statements are always reliable. The geological
information the volumes contain is of course beyond
cavil, but his observations are almost equally just on the
subjects of religion, education, and the practical working
of our political institutions. He may not convey much
information to an American, but it is but proper to admit
that his tolerant and conscientious representations will be
sure to dispel many errors and prejudices in the minds of
his own countrymen. An Englishman is apt to consider
it a duty to believe every thing bad against the United
States, and it is pleasant to think that a man with the
social and scientific position of Sir Charles Lyell has the
disposition as well as the power to present the good side
of our society for foreign contemplation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the eighth chapter of his first volume, Lyell discusses
the Sea Serpent, and comes to the conclusion that it is a
Basking Shark. Since his book was published the creature
has been seen again off Nahaut Beach, and the shark
hypothesis completely overturned. We perceive that
Agassiz believes in the Serpent, and his opinion is almost
as authoritative as Lyell’s reasonings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An interesting chapter in these volumes is devoted to
the reprints of English books, in the course of which the
author gives an account of the mammoth establishment of
the Harpers. In the course of the year 1845 the publishers
sold two millions of volumes. Their success with particular
books seems to have filled Lyell with as much
wonder as he is capable of feeling. They sold 80,000
copies of the Wandering Jew, and 40,000 copies of Bulwer’s
Last of the Barons. Up to April, 1849, they had
disposed of 40,000 copies of Macaulay’s History, at prices
varying from four dollars to fifty cents, and they calculated
that the publishers of other editions had sold 20,000,
making in all 60,000 copies of one book in about three
months. The circulation of the same work in Great Britain
had been almost unprecedented, considering that the
price was thirty-two shillings, and yet during the same
period only 13,000 copies were disposed of. Since that
period the English circulation has risen to 20,000, and we
doubt not the American has nearly reached 80,000. Lyell
seems to think, in alluding to these facts, that what the
English author loses in money by an absence of copyright
in America, he makes up in popularity and fame.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Liberty of Rome: A History with an Historical Account
of the Liberty of Ancient Nations. By Samuel Eliot.
New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 2 vols. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This work, though composed of two solid octavos, each
numbering five hundred pages, is still but the beginning
of a series. The adventurous author intends to follow
them up with a line of successors, devoting a brace of
volumes to the Liberty of the Early Christian Ages, another
to the Liberty of the Middle Ages, and still another
to the Liberty of Europe since the Reformation. In addition
to these, separate works are to be produced on the
Liberty of England and that of America. Few, even
among the giants of one idea, could contemplate such a
vision of labor without despair, but Mr. Eliot has fully
made up his mind to undertake the task; and there seems
to be in him a power, possessed by few scholars, of unflinchingly
looking in the face a prospect of dogged work,
which will probably carry him through the business. The
present volumes are able, full of learning, inspired by a
genuine love of liberty and a genuine sense of religion,
and are not deficient in historical sagacity. They reflect
great credit on the author’s industry and ability, and, in
many respects, are an addition to historical and to American
literature. It would be foreign to our purpose to
attempt an abstract of his labors, stretching as they do
over a vast field of facts and principles, but it can be confidently
asserted of his book, that it can hardly be read
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
without increasing our knowledge, and inspiring an admiration
of the author’s spirit, and a respect for his learning.
If Mr. Eliot fails in securing the attention of a large
class of readers, it will not be because he has nothing of importance
to communicate, but because he does not exactly
understand the best mode of communicating it. His style
is generally languid, oppressed with words brought in to
limit propositions, and the sentences are unconnected by
that fusing spirit which gives directness and movement to
narration and disquisition. These defects are perhaps the
more observable, as the style is ambitious to the extent of
suggesting an effort after correctness, and, with little
freshness and energy, is replete with images seen through
an unimaginative haze of words, and implying the absence
rather than the possession of poetical power. The fault
of the work, in short, is the fault of a person unpracticed
in composition, and substituting a heavy rhetoric for a
natural style; the merits are of a kind which the purest
and raciest writers might be proud to claim.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Penance of Roland, a Romance of the Peine Forte et
Dure, and Other Poems. By Henry B. Hirst, Author of
Endymion, etc. Boston: Ticknor, Reed &amp; Fields. 1 vol.
16 mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume, though it contains nothing equal in classic
beauty and grace to the exquisite poem of Endymion, has
striking merits of another kind, indicating that the author’s
genius is versatile, and can roam at will into many regions
of song. The Penance of Roland is a long and spirited
ballad story, giving free play to a variety of strong passions,
and hurrying the reader swiftly along on a rushing
stream of musical verse to the conclusion. The author
has united narration and description in such an artistical
manner, as to make his representations of scenery and
moods of mind aid instead of obstructing the story; and
he produces a strict unity of effect, by making every thing
serve the dominant idea of the poem. In this power of
grasping a leading idea, of conceiving a poem, Mr. Hirst
is ever pre-eminently successful. This was the great
charm of Endymion, and it is just as observable in the
smaller pieces contained in the present volume as in that
longer work. Of the whole nineteen there is not one
which is merely a collection of melodious lines, embodying
certain fancies and imaginations, but each is a short
poem, imaginatively conceived and artistically executed.
We have no space to refer to them individually, but it can
be said of them generally, that they display a profound
insight into the mysteries of melody both in metre and
rhythm, and evince great strength and subtilty of imagination
in the embodiment of varying moods of mind.
The volume is a rich addition to the poetical literature of
the country.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>History of the National Constituent Assembly. By J. F.
Corkran, Esq. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this interesting volume was in daily attendance
at the National Assembly for some months, and
his book is a record of his personal observation of men
and debates, including a view of the measures introduced
into the Assembly, and the mode in which they were discussed.
The author is an Englishman, and his eye is not
always perfectly accurate in his perception of French
character; but he is far beyond most of his countrymen
even in this particular. He gives tolerably correct views
of the different factions which divided the nation after
the Revolution of February—the Red and the Moderate
Republicans, Socialists, Communists, Bonapartists and
Monarchists; and some capital portraits are drawn of
Lamartine, Louis Blanc, Cremieux, Garnier Pages, Arago,
Marie, Murrast, Thieré, Barrot, Berryer, Dupin, Rollin,
Cavaignac, Mole, and Marshal Bugeaud. One of the
most interesting portions of the volume we have found to
be the account of Pierre Leroux. Mr. Corkran is evidently
ignorant of the fact that Leroux is one of the profoundest
metaphysicians of France, that he not only demolished
the Eclectic system of Cousin, but is himself a
man with positive philosophical ideas, and accordingly he
considers him simply as a political socialist, who fails as
a public speaker. Leroux is thus described: “Beneath a
prodigious mass, or mop, of black hair, as wild and entangled
as the brushwood of a virgin forest, slumber a
pair of misty, dreamy eyes, while the spectator’s ears are
regaled with the sounds of a sing-song voice, going
through an interminable history of human society, from
the earliest days to the present time, for the purpose of
showing that the world has hitherto been on a wrong
social track, and struggling in the toils of a great mistake.”
It seems that Leroux was in the habit of reading his
speeches, and though he at first obtained the ear of the
Assembly, he was ruined by having it proved upon him
that he was in the custom of reading one of his own unsaleable
printed pamphlets instead of a speech written for
the occasion. Mr. Corkran says, “when he attempted to
read afterward, a resolution was gravely proposed that no
books should be read at the tribune. Well do I recollect
the scowl with which the philosopher slowly ascended
the tribune.”</p>

Huan. By the Brothers Mayhew. New York: Harper
&amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The authors of this little volume are the same who
wrote the popular and charming book entitled, “The
Good Genius that Turned Everything into Gold;” and
their present contribution to a cause equally good, has
the peculiar interest of a fairy tale in the treatment of facts
historically accurate. The subject of benevolence, and
the miracles it works, have rarely been presented in a
manner more likely to win converts among readers of all
dispositions and capacities. The illustrations by Kenny
Meadows and George Cruikshank, are excellent; and the
same may be said of the typography of the volume.</p>

New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a work on Elocution deserving the title of
scientific, excelling, as it does, in the generalization and
statement of laws any book of the kind published on either

certainly is most thorough in pronunciation, punctuation,
modulation, the classification of sentences, and emphasis.
It is not only an admirable book for schools, but it contains
much to interest every person who would write and
speak the English language accurately, and there are few
English scholars so accomplished as not to be able to obtain
new and valuable information from its perusal.</p>

rapid succession that we presume they have attained great
popularity. Certainly few books are better calculated to
improve and instruct young minds. The present volume
is devoted to Cæsar, one of the world’s three military
wonders, and his eventful life is portrayed with much
vigor and clearness of narration.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
